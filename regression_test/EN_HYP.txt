POD1000000004_S0000041 WHEN BLUE APRON BEGAN IN 2012 IT WAS SUPPOSED TO REVOLUTIONIZE HOW AMERICANS ATE IT WAS GOING TO GENTLY PULL US AWAY FROM OUR TAKEOUT AND OUR TV DINNERS AND NOT JUST BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND FOR A WHILE IT WORKED UNTIL IT DIDN'T
POD1000000004_S0000042 AND AMERICANS RETURNED TO THE WARM EMBRACE OF THEIR BOX MAC AND CHEESE AND TAKE OUT PAD THAI OBVIOUSLY A HOME COOKING REVOLUTION DIDN'T MATERIALIZE
POD1000000004_S0000043 OR DID IT THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS HAS FORCED MANY OF US TO BECOME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR CASSEROLE DISHES AND OUR GARLIC PRESSES AND ARE DUTCH OVENS
POD1000000004_S0000044 WE MADE BANANA BREAD BY THE PALLID AND SOURDOUGH STARTER BY THE TON WE LEARNED HOW TO SEE HER STAKES AND SPATCHCOCK CHICKENS AND ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME CARNIVOROUS TECHNIQUES IN SHORT BOY DID WE EVER COOK
POD1000000004_S0000045 ALL THIS COOKING AT HOME CREATED A MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT FOR BLUE APRON BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THE COMPANY WAS VALUED AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS NOW IT WAS BARELY HANGING ON BY ITS FINGERNAILS
POD1000000004_S0000046 IT'S ONLY LIFELINE A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS OR REQUIRED SO MANY OF US TO SHELTER IN PLACE FOR MONTHS AND AVOID TRIPS TO THE GROCERY STORE
POD1000000004_S0000047 I'M LAUREN OBERON FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA WELCOME TO THE NEW SEASON OF SPECTACULAR FAILURES THE SHOW THAT ALWAYS FLAMBE IS THE HELL OUT OF FAILURE
POD1000000004_S0000049 LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE IDEA FOR BLUE APRON BEGAN WITH AN ARGENTINEAN STEAK THERE WERE THESE TWO GUYS MATT SALZBURG AND ELIA PAPAS AND THEY WERE CLEVER TECH ENTREPRENEUR TYPE
POD1000000004_S0000050 FULL OF IDEAS SALZBURG HAD AN MBA FROM HARVARD AND CUT HIS TEETH INTO BIG NEW YORK VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM PAPA'S WAS A GO GETTER SOFTWARE ENGINEER THEY MET IN A NETWORK E HAPPY HOUR AND DECIDED TO GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER
POD1000000004_S0000051 BUT WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
POD1000000004_S0000052 THEIR ORIGINAL IDEA IS NOT MILK ITS IT IS MORE OF A RESEARCH CROWDFUNDING IDEA CALLED PETRI DISH
POD1000000004_S0000053 THAT'S ALEX CONRAD HE'S A SENIOR EDITOR FORBES HE WROTE ABOUT THE FOUNDERS IN 2015 PETRI DISH WASN'T THE PAIRS ONLY STARTUP IDEA
POD1000000004_S0000054 I THINK ANOTHER ONE WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ARTICLE WAS WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS
POD1000000004_S0000055 DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
POD1000000004_S0000057 HIGH END BUT ALSO AFFORDABLE STROLLER EXPERIENCE YEAH
POD1000000004_S0000058 SO THOSE TWO START UP IDEAS A KICKSTARTER FOR SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS AND A WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS WERE NON STARTERS FOR THE PAIR BUT THEN OVER GRILLED MEAT IT HIT THEM
POD1000000004_S0000059 SALZBURG AND PAPAS ARE DOING DINNER AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ARGENTINIAN STEAKS ON A BORROWED GRILL
POD1000000004_S0000060 AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE'S A SERVICE BASICALLY FOR AMATEURS LIKE US
POD1000000004_S0000061 IN FACT THERE WAS BUT IT WAS IN SWEDEN IN 2007 A WOMAN NAMED KIKI TANNER CREATED A COMPANY CALLED
POD1000000004_S0000062 ME DOES FRED THAT TRANSLATES INTO DINNER PIECE IN ENGLISH
POD1000000004_S0000063 LET ME SEE IF I CAN PRONOUNCE THIS RIGHT ME DISCREET
POD1000000004_S0000064 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
POD1000000004_S0000065 DEANDRE WANTED TO SOLVE THE VEXING NIGHTLY PROBLEM THAT FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD FACE WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER BECAUSE THE ANSWER CAN'T ALWAYS BE ICE CREAM
POD1000000004_S0000066 PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HELL OUR YOU KNOW LIKE THE OUR BETWEEN 5 AND 6 WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN TO THE GROCERY STORE AND AND FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE ABOUT WHO'S COOKING TONIGHT WHAT ARE WE HAVING
POD1000000004_S0000067 THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
POD1000000004_S0000068 I THINK THE QUESTION IS THEN IS THIS A LEGITIMATELY HUGE PROBLEM AND IS THIS A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE AS WELL
POD1000000004_S0000069 FIRST SALZBURG AND PAPAS THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES NOW AT THIS POINT IT WAS 2012 AND TENDERS COMPANY HAD BEEN AROUND FOR FIVE YEARS AND WAS GROWING STEADILY
POD1000000004_S0000070 IT HAD A FEW COMPETITORS IN EUROPE BUT IN THE U.S. NOTHING OF THE SORT EXISTED WHICH WAS GREAT FOR SALZBURG AND PAPAS
POD1000000004_S0000071 AND SO THEY THINK HEY WE CAN START OUR OWN MEAL KIT COMPANY FOR THE US MARKET CALLED PART AND
POD1000000004_S0000072 TO BE CLEAR THAT'S A TERRIBLE NAME AND VERY QUICKLY THEY CHANGED IT TO BLUE APRON NAMED FOR WHAT FRENCH APPRENTICE CHEFS WE'RE IN THE KITCHEN
POD1000000004_S0000073 ADD ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TIME A HARVARD CLASSMATE OF SALZBURG BEGAN A RIVAL MEAL KIT COMPANY CALLED PLATED BUT SALZBURG AND PAPAS WEREN'T WORRIED BECAUSE THEY HAD BROUGHT ON A RINGER
POD1000000004_S0000074 MATT WADI ACK A CHEF WITH A DEGREE FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AND WADI HAWK WAS THE GUY THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESS STAND APART FROM ITS RIVALS
POD1000000004_S0000075 WADI ACK WOULD BASICALLY GO AND SOURCE THE INGREDIENTS FARMERS WOULD SAY OKAY WE WOULD LOVE TO LOCK IN THESE LARGE EXTRA ORDERS
POD1000000004_S0000076 AT A SCALE THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO US YOU KNOW MANY THOUSANDS OF INGREDIENTS I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS IN HIS FOOD WORLD THAT WAS A DIFFERENTIATOR AND GREAT FOR BLUE APRON
POD1000000004_S0000077 NOT ONLY DID WADDY ACT DESIGN THE MENUS AND SOURCE THE PRODUCTS BUT HE ALSO SERVED AS HE SOCIAL MEDIA FACE OF THE COMPANY HE WAS BLUE APRONS CULINARY SECRET WEAPON AND DID A SERIES OF EARLY YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWCASING HIS KNOW HOW
POD1000000004_S0000078 HERE HE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT ARTICHOKES AREN'T VIAL
POD1000000004_S0000079 EVERYBODY LIKES ARTICHOKES BUT THEY ARE CRAZY WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM THEY'RE TOUGH THEY'RE SPINY THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE THEY'RE KIND OF CONFUSING A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T COOK THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO COOK THEM
POD1000000004_S0000081 HE CUTS THEM TO SOME TRULY REVOLTING ARTICHOKES AND PROCEEDS TO MAKE MY WORST DINING NIGHTMARE
POD1000000004_S0000082 GET IN THERE WITH A SPOON AND SCOOP OUT THAT REALLY HAIRY CHOKEY INTERIOR IN THE REASON WHY THEY CALL IT THE CHOKE IS BECAUSE IF YOU EAT THIS YOU'RE GOING TO CHOKE IT'S FULL OF LITTLE FIBERS AND IT'S LIKE A FISH BONE
POD1000000004_S0000083 IN THE EARLY DAYS ALL THE FOUNDERS HAD TO HUSTLE LIKE THIS BEFORE THEY HAD STAFF IT WAS SALZBURG PAPAS AND WADI ACK PACKING UP BOXES IN A SMALL KITCHEN IN LONG ISLAND CITY NEW YORK
POD1000000004_S0000084 THEN SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE THE COMPANY LANDED SOME SWEET VENTURE CAPITAL TO THE TUNE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR THE STARTUP
POD1000000004_S0000085 WITHIN THE FIRST FEW YEARS THE BUSINESS TOOK OFF IN 2014 BLUE APRON WORSHIPING 600 THOUSAND MEALS A MONTH BY 2016 IT WAS EIGHT MILLION MEALS AND A BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
POD1000000004_S0000086 WITHIN JUST FIVE YEARS OF ITS FOUNDING THE COMPANY EMPLOYED 4,500 PEOPLE AND WAS VALUED AT NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BLUE APRON LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ON THE EXPRESS TRAIN TO SUCCESSFUL
POD1000000004_S0000087 WHO APRON SEEM TO BE SORT OF THE BUZZIEST THE BIGGEST MARKET SHARE THE LEADER IN THIS EMERGING CATEGORY
POD1000000004_S0000088 WHICH INCLUDED HELLO FRESH SUN BASKET AND ABOUT A MILLION COMPANIES WITH THE WORD CHEF IN THE NAME
POD1000000004_S0000089 THEN I ACTUALLY TRIED THE PRODUCTS AND IT SEEMED AT LEAST TO ME PERSONALLY JUST AS SOMEONE TESTING THE PRODUCTS THAT BLUE APRON OVER ALL KIND OF HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT RESONATED THE MOST WITH ME AND I THOUGHT MIGHT RESONATE THE MOST WITH AMERICANS
POD1000000004_S0000090 NOW THE THING ABOUT AMERICANS IS
POD1000000004_S0000091 WE LOVE PRODUCTS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER MORE CONVENIENT LESS OF A HASSLE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BLUE APRON WAS DOING IT WAS SAYING HEY WORKING MOM WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE LOL
POD1000000004_S0000092 WE WANT TO HELP YOU COOK NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS MEALS FOR YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE OR READING A COOKBOOK
POD1000000004_S0000093 BUT IT WAS ALSO SAYING HEY MILLENNIAL WE KNOW YOU'RE A WORK HARD PLAY HARD EAT SLOPPY TAKE OUT AT 9 P.M. KIND OF PERSON BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'D LOVE TO COOK IF ONLY IT WASN'T SUCH A TIME CONSUMING PAIN IN THE ASS
POD1000000004_S0000094 SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT SUPER CONVENIENT FOR YOU
POD1000000004_S0000096 THIS AMERICAN OBSESSION WITH CONVENIENCE AROUND FOOD AND IN PARTICULAR THE MAGICAL HOME COOKED MEAL   THE EFFORT GOES BACK TO AT LEAST THE LATE 19TH CENTURY SAYS CULINARY HISTORIAN LAURA SHAPIRO
POD1000000004_S0000097 THAT WAS WHEN A PARTICULAR BRAND OF UTOPIAN FICTION BEGAN TO EMERGE
POD1000000004_S0000098 THE PLOT WAS SORT OF THE SAME SOMEBODY IS TAKING A WALK THEY GET BONKED ON THE HEAD WHEN THEY WAKE UP IT'S FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE STRANGE LOOKING CREATURES AND IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD
POD1000000004_S0000099 AND SOMEBODY TAKES THEM TO DINNER THEY TAKE THEM HOME TO DINNER AND IT'S A MIRACLE DINNER
POD1000000004_S0000100 THE FOOD JUST APPEARED WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON OR THE WAVE OF AN ARM AND IT WAS SCRUMPTIOUS AND FILLING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BACK THEN
POD1000000004_S0000101 MIRACLE FOOD WAS UTOPIAN FOOD AND THAT HAS BEEN A DREAM I THINK THAT HAS ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE AMERICAN DINNER TABLE FOR DECADES AND DECADES
POD1000000004_S0000102 NOT LONG AFTER THE EMERGENCE OF THIS UTOPIAN FICTION DINING ACTUALLY DID START TO LOOK LIKE A MIRACLE YOU CAN BUY VEGETABLES IN A CAN AND CHICKEN IN A CAN AND LATER FULL MEALS LIKE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS IN A CAN
POD1000000004_S0000103 THEN IN THE 1950S CAME THE FROZEN TURKEY DINNER JUST WHACK IT IN THE OVEN AND PRESTO A RUBBERY SIMULACRUM OF THE REAL THING BUT IT WAS QUICK AND CLEAN UP WAS A BREEZE
POD1000000004_S0000104 MOTHER MURPHY LUCKY ME MY WIFE USES WATSON TV TURKEY DINNERS AND MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LUCKY TO GET SWANSON TV TURKEY DINNERS SWANSON TV FRIED CHICKEN DINNERS
POD1000000004_S0000105 SWANSON TV BEEF DINNERS FROM YOUR GROCERS BIG FREEZE
POD1000000004_S0000106 WHEN FROZEN FISH STICKS AT THE SCENE AROUND THE SAME TIME BUDDY IT WAS UTOPIAN FICTION COME TO LIFE
POD1000000004_S0000107 MASTER CHAD MORLEY EIGHT MRS. PAUL'S FISH STICKS WITH HIS FINGERS
POD1000000004_S0000108 NOW I'M 32 AND I USE A FORK SOMETIMES
POD1000000004_S0000109 MRS. PAUL'S FISH STICKS YOU NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM
POD1000000004_S0000110 IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS THESE YOU KNOW DEEP FRIED FROZEN FISH STICKS THAT TASTED NOT AT ALL OF FISH WHICH MEANT THAT PEOPLE ADORED THEM
POD1000000004_S0000111 OBVIOUSLY FISH STICKS TOOK OFF AND THE INDUSTRY USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO STICK A FI EVERYTHING CHICKEN EGGPLANT LIMA BEANS WHATEVER YOU COULD DEEP FRY AND FREEZE THE PACKAGED FOOD INDUSTRY TRIED IT
POD1000000004_S0000112 THE POST WAR YEARS ALSO BROUGHT AN EXPLOSION OF FAST FOOD AND TAKEOUT MEALS AND NOW IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE CAN ORDER JUST ABOUT ANY FOOD WE WANT FROM SOME VEGAN DRUMSTICKS TO A PREFIX OLD CUISINE MEAL JUST BY PRESSING A NAP
POD1000000004_S0000113 ALL OF THESE ITERATIONS OF THE MIRACLE DINNER IT'S LIKE THEY AIM AT THREE LONGINGS THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT MAKING DINNER THEY WANT IT TO BE EFFORTLESS
POD1000000004_S0000114 THEY WANTED TO BE DELICIOUS AND THEY WANTED TO HAVE THE MORAL VALUE OF HOME COOKING
POD1000000004_S0000115 THE HOME COOKING ASPECT OF THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST RESONANT
POD1000000004_S0000116 THE THING THAT HOME COOKING DELIVERS THAT NONE OF THESE OTHER THINGS DO IS THAT IT SATISFIES I THINK WHAT WE ALL FEEL AS THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO COOK
POD1000000004_S0000117 THERE'S SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T CLICK IN WHEN THE THING COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE
POD1000000004_S0000118 AND THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR A COMPANY LIKE BLUE APRON BECAUSE
POD1000000004_S0000119 BLUE APRON INCHES A LITTLE CLOSER TO THAT IT JUST IT GETS YOU THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FEELING AS THOUGH YOU HAVE COOKED THIS
POD1000000004_S0000120 NOTICE SHAPIRO SAID FEELING AS THOUGH YOU COOKED SOMETHING BECAUSE FOR HER WHAT BLUE APRON IS DOING DESPITE ALL OF ITS FRESH INGREDIENTS AND CHEF INSPIRED RECIPES IS HELPING YOU
POD1000000004_S0000121 THEY KIND OF FOOL YOU INTO THINKING YOU'RE COOKING OR IS REAL COOKING HANDS ON COOKING KNOWLEDGEABLE COOKING HAS TO DO WITH COOKING DAY AFTER DAY
POD1000000004_S0000122 DOES IT MEAN YOU'RE MAKING FABULOUS ELABORATE MEALS DAY AFTER DAY EVEN IF IT'S THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE THING THAT'S COOKING
POD1000000004_S0000123 SURE GETTING A DIME BAG OF ZA'ATAR A THIMBLE FULL OF PEPITAS AND A LITERAL TABLESPOON OF SESAME OIL IN YOUR MILK IT DOES HAVE A SOMEWHAT INFANTILIZING EFFECT
POD1000000004_S0000124 BUT IN BLUE APRONS EARLY YEARS PLENTY OF PEOPLE WERE HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYTHING PORTIONED OUT FOR THEM BUT CONVINCING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WANTED AND NEEDED TO SERVICE LIKE THAT THAT COST THE COMPANY SOME BIG CASH
POD1000000004_S0000125 IN THE FORM OF FREE MEALS TONS OF SPECIALS AND ENDLESS ADVERTISING ANYONE WHO LISTEN TO PODCASTS AND 2015 THROUGH 2018 IS BOUND TO HAVE HEARD AT LEAST ONE DISINTERESTED PODCAST HOST GIVE A LACKLUSTER BLUE APRON ADDRESS
POD1000000004_S0000127 IN BIZ SPEAK ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN AS THE CAC OR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
POD1000000004_S0000128 WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY SPENT
POD1000000004_S0000129 ON MARKETING TO ACQUIRE CUSTOMERS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY ACTUALLY ACQUIRE
POD1000000004_S0000130 THAT'S DAN MCCARTHY HE'S A MARKETING PROFESSOR AT EMORY UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS SCHOOL AND HE'S STUDIED BLUE APRON FOR YEARS MCCARTHY SAYS THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS BLUE APRON WAS SPENDING ABOUT 60 70 DOLLARS PER CUSTOMER
POD1000000004_S0000131 BUT THEN AS PEOPLE CAME AND WENT BLUE APRON HAD TO SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS ON BOARD THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST JUST KEPT CREEPING UP AND UP AND UP UNTIL IT NEARLY DOUBLED
POD1000000004_S0000132 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED TWENTY GUESTS TO BRING SOMEBODY IN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT THAT YOU NEED AFTER THAT TO BREAK EVEN ON THAT CUSTOMER THAT'S A TOUGHER PROPOSITION
POD1000000004_S0000133 THE MORE MONEY BLUE APRON SPENT THE HARDER IT WAS TO RECOUP THE INVESTMENT WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND PROBLEM PREVENTING CUSTOMERS FROM BOLTING ONCE THE COMPANY HAS SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TO BRING THEM IN
POD1000000004_S0000134 HOW MANY CUSTOMERS STICK AROUND IS MEASURED BY A REALLY IMPORTANT METRIC CALLED CHURN RATE THE CHURN RATE TELLS YOU THE RATE AT WHICH CUSTOMERS COME INTO AND SPIN OUT OF THE BUSINESS
POD1000000004_S0000135 IF YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF CASH TO LAND NEW CUSTOMERS AND THEY DON'T STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF THEM YOU HAVE HIGH CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS AND HIGH CHURN RATE
POD1000000004_S0000136 THAT'S WHERE BLUE APRON FOUND ITSELF AND EVEN THE MOST BASIC COOKING DODO COULD TELL YOU THAT'S A GOURMET RECIPE FOR LOSING A LOT OF MONEY
POD1000000004_S0000137 OUR PAL DR. GREENE USED BLUE APRON FOR ABOUT A YEAR WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN MOST OF ITS CUSTOMERS STUCK AROUND
POD1000000004_S0000138 YES ABOUT HALF THE PEOPLE WERE CHURNING OUT IN A MONTH BY SIX MONTHS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WERE CHURNING OUT THEY JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO KEEP THOSE CUSTOMERS FOR AS LONG AS THEY SHOULD
POD1000000004_S0000139 DESPITE BLUE APRONS EARLY SUCCESS AND GROWTH ONE NOT THE COMPANY HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CRACK IS HOW TO STOP THAT OUTFLOW HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO SUBSCRIBE AND STAY SUBSCRIBE AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF THEM IT'S A PUZZLE
POD1000000004_S0000140 BUT DESPITE ITS HIGH CHURN RATE BLUE APRON WAS STILL THE MARKET LEADER IT HAD GOTTEN A SLIGHT JUMP START ON RIVAL HELLO FRESH AND WAS STARTING TO LOOK REAL SEXY TO BIG INVESTORS
POD1000000004_S0000141 THEY WERE THE 800 POUND GORILLAS AND EVEN THOUGH THE SPACE ITSELF WASN'T THAT THAT LARGE AT THE TIME IT WAS STILL SOMETHING LIKE 5 BILLION DOLLARS AND GROWING REALLY QUICKLY
POD1000000004_S0000142 ON ITS FACE BUSINESS SEEM BOOMING BUT THE WHOLE MEAL KIT MARKET WAS ON THE CUSP OF A SHAKE UP
POD1000000004_S0000143 IN 2017 GROCERY CHAINS ALBERTSONS AND KROGER EACH PICKED OFF COMPETING MEAL KIT COMPANIES THEN ANOTHER BLUE APRON RIVAL SHEFTE ABRUPTLY SHUT DOWN AND LAID OFF ALL ITS EMPLOYEES ONLY TO BE BOUGHT A WEEK LATER
POD1000000004_S0000144 AND SO BLUE APRON WAS AT A CROSSROAD SAYS ALEX CONRAD
POD1000000004_S0000145 FOR STARTUPS THE MOST COMMON EXITS ARE YOU KNOW YOU FAIL YOU GO PUBLIC OR YOU GOT BOUGHT THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TRADITIONAL OUTCOMES AND SO FOR THE COMPANIES THAT DIDN'T WANT TO FAIL THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GO PUBLIC SOMEDAY OR CELL
POD1000000004_S0000146 LIKE THAT THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE REALITY

POD1000000004_S0000164 GET STARTED TODAY AT BETTER HEELP.COM SPECTACULAR
POD1000000004_S0000166 NO STORY ABOUT BLUE APRON COULD BE CALLED COMPLETE WITHOUT SAMPLING THE PRODUCT SO I ORDERED UP A BOX AND PAID FOR IT MIND YOU
POD1000000004_S0000167 OKAY SO I JUST GOT MY BLUE APRON BOX AT MY DOORSTEP AND WHEN I PICKED IT UP I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW HEAVY IT WAS
POD1000000004_S0000168 WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED IT FELT LIKE CHRISTMAS EXCEPT BETTER BECAUSE THE FOOD WASN'T MEDIOCRE AND ARRANGED IN A SHRINK WRAP
POD1000000004_S0000169 SO LET'S CRACK INTO THIS BOX
POD1000000004_S0000170 INSIDE THERE WERE TWO BUNCHES OF KALE SOME LOOSE ONIONS AND ABOUT A MILLION TINY BAGGIES OF KNICKKNACKS INCLUDING 2 TABLESPOONS OF CRÈME FRAÎCHE 1/4 OF A CUP OF PANKO BREAD CRUMBS AND 1 TEASPOON OF SOMETHING CALLED FOR A COCKY
POD1000000004_S0000171 WHICH ACCORDING TO THE BLUE APRON RECIPE WAS SUPPOSED TO QUOTE LEND EVEN MORE SAVORY FLAVOR TO MY DISH YUM
POD1000000004_S0000173 THERE'S THE TINIEST THE TINIEST TINIEST PORTION OF BROWN RICE I MEAN THIS MUST BE MAYBE HALF A CUP IN A BAG MAYBE THREE TIMES THE SIZE
POD1000000004_S0000174 I DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE SAD TO COOK THESE DISHES BY MYSELF SO I INVITED MY GIRLFRIEND OVER TO EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC OF BLUE APRON WITH ME
POD1000000004_S0000175 YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN MEALS TONIGHT
POD1000000004_S0000176 THAT'S ALREADY MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M SO HUNGRY
POD1000000004_S0000177 OH WELL WE HAVE THE CHOICE OF THREE DISHES BUT ONE OF THEM HAD CILANTRO SAUCE OH NO THANK YOU ANOTHER WAS LIKE A SPICY INDIAN SITUATION AND I WAS FEELING KIND OF BASIC SO I CHOSE THE PESTO AND KALE PASTA WITH GOAT CHEESE
POD1000000004_S0000178 IT SAYS THIS QUICK COOKING PASTA GETS A ONE TWO PUNCH OF IRRESISTIBLE FLAVOR FROM A DOLLOP OF CREAMY GOAT CHEESE FOR DELICIOUS TANG AND OUR HERBACEOUS BASIL PESTO STIRRED INTO THE WARM PASTA AND GARLICKY KALE JUST BEFORE SIR
POD1000000004_S0000179 BY THE WAY THAT WAS WRONG
POD1000000004_S0000180 HERBACEOUS
POD1000000004_S0000181 TOUCH OF CRUSHED RED
POD1000000004_S0000182 TECHNICALLY WE PICK THE EASIEST DISH SO WHAT THINGS WERE GOING WELL UNTIL I DROPPED A GARLIC CLOVE DOWN THE INSINKERATOR
POD1000000004_S0000183 OH NO GARY AND OUT OF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL
POD1000000004_S0000184 AFTER THAT NEAR CATASTROPHE WE BOILED THE FRESH CAVATELLI SAUTEED THE KALE WITH GARLIC AND RED PEPPER FLAKES ADDED THE PESTO AND THE DOLLOP OF GOAT CHEESE AND VOILA
POD1000000004_S0000185 CAN I GET YOU A BOWL OF PASTA
POD1000000004_S0000186 
POD1000000004_S0000187 YOU COULD
POD1000000004_S0000188 AND I'M HERE TO REPORT WE MADE A DAMN FINE MEAL THE KALE WAS TENDER CRISP AND VERY WELL SEASONED THE CAVATELLI WAS PERFECTLY AL DENTE WELL DONE HANNAH AND THE CHEESE ADDED SOME GOOD SALTINESS
POD1000000004_S0000189 I WOULD SAY WE ARE PERFECTLY SATISFIED DINERS BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
POD1000000004_S0000190 WELL YOU KNOW IT'S PRACTICALLY NOTHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAME OUT OF A PACKET SO REALLY WE'RE ONLY LEFT WITH
POD1000000004_S0000191 THAT'S REALLY NICE
POD1000000004_S0000192 A COUPLE OF DISHES
POD1000000004_S0000193 DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE
POD1000000004_S0000194 BUT NOT EVERYONE WHO'S USED BLUE APRON HAS APPRECIATED THAT THE COMPANY HAS GOTTEN FLACK FOR ITS ABUNDANT PACKAGING THOUGH MUCH OF IT IS NOW RECYCLABLE AND CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE RECIPES WERE TOO COMPLICATED
POD1000000004_S0000195 I MADE FOR BLUE APRON MEALS FOR THE STORY AND FOR A MIDDLING COOK WITH A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF COOKWARE I THOUGHT THE DISHES WERE PRETTY SIMPLE TO ASSEMBLE ALSO PRETTY TASTY
POD1000000004_S0000196 I WOULD MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DISHES AGAIN BUT I DO THE SHOPPING MYSELF WHICH I GUESS SORT OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
POD1000000004_S0000197 WHEN I OPENED MY FIRST BLUE APRON BOX IT WAS A NOVELTY A CORNUCOPIA AND CARDBOARD BUT THEN I FORGOT TO CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION AND I GOT A SECOND BOX BY ACCIDENT
POD1000000004_S0000198 THAT ONE WASN'T AS EXCITING BY THEN I UNDERSTOOD THE GIMMICK AND THE EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERY KIND OF FIZZLED IN THIS WAY I'M NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TRY BLUE APRON SAYS PROFESSOR DAN MCCARTHY
POD1000000004_S0000199 DISCOVERY DOESN'T TEND TO LAST THAT LONG THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEY LOOK AT BLUE APRON AS THIS YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I WANT KIND OF THIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT EVERY MONTH
POD1000000004_S0000200 AND THE PROBLEM IS THEY MAY WANT THAT INITIALLY BUT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED A FEW TIMES YOU SAY YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY GOOD I DON'T NEED ANY MORE OF THIS PRIZE IN THE LIGHT
POD1000000004_S0000201 BUT BLUE APRON EXECS WERE LIKE YEAH YOU DO YOU NEED IT AND YOU WANT IT AND THEY BELIEVED IN THEIR PRODUCTS ABILITY NOT JUST TO CONTINUALLY DELIGHT BUT TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE A VALUABLE SERVICE TO PEOPLE
POD1000000004_S0000202 AND ALL THAT MEANT THAT IN 2017 THE COMPANY HAD TO WORK OUT ITS OPTIONS PACKET IN CELL OR GO PUBLIC
POD1000000004_S0000203 AND THE HIGHER UPS DECIDED ON GOING PUBLIC
POD1000000004_S0000204 NOW BEFORE OFFERING A PUBLIC STOCK IN THE COMPANY FOR THE FIRST TIME BLUE APRON WANTED TO SHOW STRONG CUSTOMER GROWTH SO THEY STARTED TO AMP UP SPENDING TO BRING IN NEW USERS
POD1000000004_S0000205 REMEMBER CAC THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE IPO BLUE APRON INCREASE ITS MARKET IN CASH BY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PERCENT
POD1000000004_S0000206 BUT NONE OF HIS MARKETING RESULTED IN A HUGE NEW CUSTOMER HAUL AND THAT SAYS FORBES IS ALEX CONRAD MADE INVESTORS A LITTLE LESS AND LOVE WITH THE COMPANY
POD1000000004_S0000207 IT WAS HARD TO MAKE A REALLY ATTRACTIVE YOU KNOW FUTURE FACING STORY FOR LIKE HOW BLUE APRON REALLY BECOMES THAT HUGE
POD1000000004_S0000208 BLUE APRONS BOOKS WEREN'T THE ONLY THING THAT MADE INVESTORS TURN UP THEIR NOSES AROUND THE IPO A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE BLUE APRON TEAM WAS SET TO RING THE BELL AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AMAZON MADE A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT
POD1000000004_S0000209 IT WAS BUYING WHOLE FOODS IN A 13.7 BILLION DOLLAR DEAL FOR BLUE APRON IT WAS LIKE GETTING UPSTAGED AT YOUR OWN WEDDING BY AN IMPOSSIBLY RICH AND INFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL GUEST OF A GUEST
POD1000000004_S0000210 WHEN AMAZON'S ACQUISITION OF WHOLE FOODS WAS ANNOUNCED THAT WAS JUST DEVASTATING EVEN JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT FELT LIKE YOU KNOW HERE COME THE GIANTS
POD1000000004_S0000211 AND IF AMAZON CAN SELL THINGS TO ONLINE REALLY WELL AND WHOLE FOODS HAS PRETTY GOOD INGREDIENTS WHAT IS BLUE APRON REALLY SELLING HERE
POD1000000004_S0000212 AND THEN OF COURSE AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS OWN MEAL KIT
POD1000000004_S0000213 EVERYONE WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT BASICALLY THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT YOU KNOW I WON'T CALL BLUE APRON AND AUNT YOU KNOW BUT I WOULD SAY EVERYONE AGREE AMAZON'S WAY BIGGER SO
POD1000000004_S0000215 THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BOULDER WAY RIGHT IN AND STAMP THIS THIS INDUSTRY OUT AND SO THAT THAT WAS A BIG LURKING CONCERN
POD1000000004_S0000216 BLUEPRINTS IPO IN THE SUMMER OF 2017 RAISE 300 MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED STOCK WENT FOR ABOUT $10 A SHARE RATHER THAN THE EXPECTED FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS
POD1000000004_S0000217 THERE'S A TURBULENT IPO TO SAY THE LEAST
POD1000000004_S0000218 STILL BLUE APRON CO FOUNDER AND CEO MATT SALZBERG SEEMED PRETTY UPBEAT ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION ON CNBC
POD1000000004_S0000219 I'M HONESTLY NOT HERE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE PRICING OF LABOR IN STOCK THAT'S REALLY UP TO THE INVESTORS TO DECIDE YOU KNOW BLUE APRON IS HERE BECAUSE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER
POD1000000004_S0000220 WE'RE TACKLING A HUGE MARKET AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM QUITE FRANKLY AND THE STOCK PRICE TODAY WHETHER IT'S UP DOWN LEFT OR RIGHT IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEW CHAPTER IN OUR COMPANY'S LIFE THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
POD1000000004_S0000222 ONE THING SALZBURG MENTION IN THAT CLIP WAS HOW HIS COMPANY WAS TACKLING A HUGE MARKET NOW IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE MARKET AS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO EAT FOOD IN AMERICA THEN YEAH THAT'S A HUGE MARKET
POD1000000004_S0000223 BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOOD FOLKS AT MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY PACKAGED FACTS THAT MARKET HAS A CEILING AND NOT LIKE A CATHEDRAL CEILING
POD1000000004_S0000224 INITIALLY THE MARKET WAS DEFINITELY EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE INTEREST INITIALLY CAME FROM IF YOU'RE SEEING THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING A HUNDRED PERCENT GROWTH LIKE THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT
POD1000000004_S0000225 THAT'S CARA RASH SHE'S A FOOD AND BEVERAGE ANALYST WITH PACKAGE FACTS
POD1000000004_S0000226 ONE OF THE WHOLE THINGS THAT I THINK WENT WRONG WITH THE INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS A VERY BIG ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS BUT AS IT TURNS OUT THERE REALLY ISN'T
POD1000000004_S0000227 IT'S HARD TO GAUGE BUT RASH ESTIMATES THAT ONLY ABOUT 1% OF THE US POPULATION USES HOME DELIVERY MEAL KITS AND SHE SAYS THE MARKET KIND OF PEAK 2 OR 3 YEARS AGO
POD1000000004_S0000228 SINCE BLUE APRON STARTED MORE THAN 150 MEAL KIT SERVICES OF COME ON THE SCENE BUT ONLY ABOUT 15 TO 20 OR NATIONAL OPERATIONS WITH HELLOFRESH NOW THE CLEAR MARKET LEADER
POD1000000004_S0000229 REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS MEAL KIT BACK IN 2017 RASH SAYS THE COMPANY NEVER DID MUCH WITH IT AND THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR THAT MEAL KIT DELIVERY IS NOT A GROWING GLOBAL CONCERN
POD1000000004_S0000230 I THINK THAT AMAZON SAW THAT MUCH OF THE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS HAD ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE COMPETITORS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE SO THEY DIDN'T TRY REALLY TO BREAK INTO THAT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE MUCH POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH ANYMORE
POD1000000004_S0000231 IT SEEMS LIKE AMAZON WAS RIGHT TO HOLD OFF IN 2017 BLUE APRON HEMORRHAGE 250,000 CUSTOMERS AND ITS STOCK PRICE HAD TANKED JUST $2.99 PER SHARE BY THE END OF THE YEAR
POD1000000004_S0000232 AND THERE WERE MORE PROBLEMS WITHIN A MONTH OF THE IPO CO FOUNDER MATT WADI ACTS STEP DOWN AS CEO OH MATT SALZBURG THEN THE CEO RESIGNED HIS POST SHORTLY THEREAFTER
POD1000000004_S0000233 BLUEPRINTS EXPENSIVE BRAND SPANKING NEW FULFILLMENT CENTER IN NEW JERSEY HAD A BUNCH OF TECH BUGS THAT NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT AND WORKERS FROM ITS CALIFORNIA OPERATION FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OVER ALLEGED MISSING WAGES
POD1000000004_S0000234 THINGS WERE LOOKING PRETTY GRIM FOR THE ONES HYPED COMPANY
POD1000000004_S0000235 WELCOME TO TRADING NATION I'M ERIC CHUMMY LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF LAST YEAR'S HIGH PROFILE IPOS THAT'S GETTING ABSOLUTELY SMOKED WE'RE TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT BLUE APRON THE STOCK SINKING AS MUCH AS FOUR PERCENT ON FRIDAY
POD1000000004_S0000236 BY THE END OF 2018 BLUE APRON STOCK DIPPED BELOW A DOLLAR A SHARE AND THE SLIDE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE LETTING UP
POD1000000004_S0000237 THE FOLLOWING SUMMER THE COMPANY TRY TO MOVE MEANT TO KEEP IT FROM BEING BOOTED FROM THE STOCK EXCHANGE IT'S CALLED A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
POD1000000004_S0000238 SPLIT AND BASICALLY IT MEANS THAT THE COMPANY BUNDLED IT SHARES SO YOU GET A FEWER TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES BUT EACH SHARE IS WORTH MORE LIKE TRADING IN FOUR QUARTERS FOR A DOLLAR
POD1000000004_S0000239 THE MOVE RAISED THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE BUT CUSTOMERS STILL WEREN'T FLOCKING TO BLUE APRONS BOXES NOW AT THIS POINT I WOULD HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWEL BUT NOT CEO LINDA FINLEY KOZLOWSKI
POD1000000004_S0000240 THE COMPANY WOULDN'T MAKE KOZLOWSKI AVAILABLE FOR CHAT BUT HERE SHE IS LAST YEAR ON CNBC'S SQUAWK ON THE STREET TALKING ABOUT HOW JAZZ SHE IS ABOUT BLUE APRONS PROSPECTS
POD1000000004_S0000241 AND OUR RECIPES ARE INGREDIENTS OUR CULINARY AUTHORITY OUR BRAND RECOGNITION IS BY FAR STILL NUMBER ONE SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO INVESTORS THEY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING HERE IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT GETTING EXECUTION RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
POD1000000004_S0000242 GOOGLE BUT ALSO BLUE APRON WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING DOWN WITH SOME STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SAYS MARKET WATCHES TANYA GARCIA
POD1000000004_S0000243 STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES WHICH YOU KNOW MEANS A LOT AND NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT
POD1000000004_S0000244 IT'S LIKE SAYING I'M TOTALLY HAPPY BEING SINGLE BUT I'D BE INTO DATING AFTER A PERSON CAME ALONG
POD1000000004_S0000245 IT'S KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT COMPANIES WILL SAY WHEN THEY'RE JUST LIKE WELL WE'D BE OPEN TO YOU KNOW GETTING BOUGHT OR PARTNERSHIP IF YOU'RE INTERESTED YOU KNOW KIND OF A THING
POD1000000004_S0000246 IN EARLY 2020 BLUE APRON PUT THE WORD OUT THAT IT WAS INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY GETTING SCOOPED UP MAYBE BUY A BIG GROCERY CHAIN OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH DEEP POCKETS WHO WANTED TO OWN A MEAL KIT DELIVERY BUSINESS
POD1000000004_S0000247 AT THE SAME TIME GARCIA SAYS THE COMPANY ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN TURNAROUND MODE IT DECIDED TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS INCLUDING SHUTTING DOWN ITS FULFILLMENT CENTER IN TEXAS
POD1000000004_S0000248 IT ALSO DID AWAY WITH TRYING TO SHOVEL EVERYONE WHO HAD EVER EATEN FOOD INTO THE TOP OF ITS CUSTOMER FUNNEL
POD1000000004_S0000249 THEY'VE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY CALL THEIR CORE CUSTOMERS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOING TO DO LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND USE A COUPON AND YOU KNOW GET BLUE APRON FOR A MONTH AND THEN CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTION
POD1000000004_S0000250 SO AT THE SAME TIME BLUE APRON WAS LOOKING TO SELL IT WAS ALSO DOUBLING DOWN ON ITS MISSION THESE WERE LAST GASP EFFORTS IT WANTED TO SAVE ITSELF
POD1000000004_S0000251 AND THEN CAME THE MOST UNLIKELY LIFELINE ANYONE COULD THINK OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT REQUIRE THOSE OF US WITHOUT ESSENTIAL JOBS TO PRACTICALLY NEVER LEAVE OUR HOUSES
POD1000000004_S0000252 ONLINE GROCERY DELIVERY SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE REMEMBERED ABOUT THIS COMPANY THEY HEARD ABOUT ON A PODCAST AD THREE YEARS AGO
POD1000000004_S0000253 THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ACTUALLY A BIT OF A GOOD THING FOR THEM BECAUSE IT HAS RAISED DEMAND
POD1000000004_S0000254 BLUE APRON SEES A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN WHAT THE COMPANY IS OFFERING ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MORE AMERICANS SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN COOKING AT HOME THANKS CORONA
POD1000000004_S0000255 IF YOUR BLUE APRON THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING YOU KNOW WELL IF WE DO A GOOD JOB SOME OF THIS WILL STICK
POD1000000004_S0000256 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WHEN CORONAVIRUS BROUGHT AMERICA TO A STANDSTILL BLUE APRON CUSTOMER ORDERS WERE UP A BIT THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SPIKE LIKE THE MARKETS HOPED THE COMPANY STILL LOST 20 MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER
POD1000000004_S0000257 ON ITS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CALL OF 2020 THE COMPANY'S CEO AND CFO SHOOK THEIR POM POMS LIKE THEY WERE ON AN EPISODE OF CHEER BUT LIKE THE VERSION THAT FEATURES SLIGHTLY WOODEN CORPORATE EXECUTIVES
POD1000000004_S0000258 SO NOW I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS PUTS US IN A GOOD POSITION GOING FORWARD AND AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY GUIDE TO WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES
POD1000000004_S0000259 YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS AS WE MOVE OUT OF Q2
POD1000000004_S0000260 THE PANDEMIC SEEMS LIKE IT'S GIVEN BLUE APRON A DECENT LITTLE BOOST IN THE SECOND QUARTER THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN 20,000 MORE SUBSCRIBERS BUT THAT'S STILL WAY BELOW WHERE THEY WERE IN 2019
POD1000000004_S0000261 IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS WHETHER BLUE APRON SPECIFICALLY AND MEAL KIT DELIVERY MORE GENERALLY ARE HERE TO STAY THE BUSINESS KIKI T UNDER FOUNDED IN SWEDEN 13 YEARS AGO IS STILL DELIVERING WEEKLY MEAL FIXINS TOO BUSY SWEETS
POD1000000004_S0000262 AND DESPITE ITS OWN TURBULENCE MARKET LEADER HELLOFRESH IS STILL CRANKING OUT BOXES AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF SMALL MEAL KIT COMPANIES LOOKING TO FILL PALEO OR VEGAN OR REGIONAL CUISINE NICHES
POD1000000004_S0000263 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WILL BE ON HOW WE EAT AND WHERE AND WHEN NOT YET ANYWAY GROCERY DELIVERY SEEMS LIKE IT'S HERE TO STAY
POD1000000004_S0000264 MAYBE HIGH END RESTAURANT TAKEOUT WILL ALSO STICK AROUND IN SOME FORM IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO TOOK UP HOME COOKING OUT OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BAKE CRUSTY SOURDOUGH AND WHIP UP ELABORATE CURRIES WHEN WE CAN ALL SAFELY FREQUENT OUR FAVORITE LOCAL SPOTS
POD1000000004_S0000265 BLUE APRON IS BANKING ON A SEA CHANGE IN HOW AMERICANS EAT THE COMPANY THAT WAS SHOPPING FOR A BUYER JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT IS NOW TRYING TO TURN A CATACLYSMIC GLOBAL EVENT INTO A BUSINESS SAVING OPPORTUNITY

POD1000000010_S0000034 SHE WALKED IN AND FROZE
POD1000000010_S0000035 I SAW THAT NURTURING HEALING LOVE AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POD1000000010_S0000036 NURTURING HEALING LOVE YOU CAN SEE THOSE THREE WORDS THEY'RE SPELLED PHONETICALLY IN A SIX YEAR OLDS JAGGED SCROLL
POD1000000010_S0000037 I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COME BACK HERE I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M CRYING BECAUSE USUALLY I DON'T SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000038 I'M USUALLY REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING IT TOGETHER JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT
POD1000000010_S0000040 SCARLETT SAYS SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW OR WHERE HER LITTLE BOY CAME UP WITH THOSE THREE WORDS
POD1000000010_S0000041 BUT THE MOMENT SHE SAW THEM SHE REALIZED
POD1000000010_S0000042 THIS IS MY LIFE NOW I KNEW I WOULD BE SPENDING THE REST OF MY LIFE SPREADING THIS MESSAGE

POD1000000010_S0000059 SO COREY YES KINDNESS IS IMPORTANT BUT I GUESS I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED THAT MY KIDS WOULD LEARN IT NATURALLY THROUGH OSMOSIS
POD1000000010_S0000060 JUST IF YOU LOVE THEM THEY'LL BECOME KIND
POD1000000010_S0000061 WELL YOU KNOW WHAT AREN'T YOU YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THAT ASSUMPTION
POD1000000010_S0000062 WE OFTEN JUST EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE KIND WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT IT
POD1000000010_S0000063 WE THINK OH YOU'RE A GOOD KID YOU'RE GOING TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000064 THAT IS JENNIFER KOTLER SHE'S ONE OF OUR EXPERT GUIDES TODAY THROUGH WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY COMPLICATED
POD1000000010_S0000065 KINDNESS HAS BEEN A PART OF SESAME STREET FROM THE BEGINNING SO IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT BUT
POD1000000010_S0000066 BUT SHE SAYS THE FOLKS AT SESAME AND LOTS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS ARE STARTING TO NOTICE THINGS WARNINGS
POD1000000010_S0000067 NOT ONLY IN THE HEADLINES BUT IN RESEARCH
POD1000000010_S0000068 AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FIRST TAKE AWAY THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SENDING KIDS REALLY MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000069 EXHIBIT A IS THIS STUDY JEN POINTS TO OUT OF HARVARD A FEW YEARS BACK
POD1000000010_S0000070 MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THOUGHT THAT THEIR PARENTS VALUED ACADEMIC SUCCESS OVER KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000071 IN FACT ABOUT 80% OF CHILDREN BELIEVED THEIR PARENTS WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GOOD GRADES AND THEIR KIDS CAREERS THAN WHETHER THEY WERE CARING TOWARDS OTHERS
POD1000000010_S0000072 80% AND THE PARENTS ON THE OTHER HAND THEY GOT SURVEYED TO
POD1000000010_S0000073 AND THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THIS THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR KIDS WERE GETTING
POD1000000010_S0000074 YEAH AND THIS KIND OF LIKE SELF DELUSION THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS SCARLET WORRIES THAT THIS CULTURE IS CREATING HUGE PROBLEMS
POD1000000010_S0000075 NOW AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS
POD1000000010_S0000076 AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND BULLYING AND LONELINESS BUT ALSO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL ILLNESS
POD1000000010_S0000077 AND OF COURSE HER LIFE IS A REALLY STARK REMINDER CORY OF JUST HOW HIGH THE STAKES CAN BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND KIDS WHO ARE TROUBLED
POD1000000010_S0000078 SOMETIMES IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE WE ACT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
POD1000000010_S0000079 AND WE DO KNOW WHAT TO DO
POD1000000010_S0000080 AFTER SHE READ THAT MESSAGE FROM JESSE SCARLETT LEWIS REACHED OUT TO A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS AND SHE CREATED A PLAN TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CHILDREN KINDNESS STEP BY STEP VALUE BY VALUE
POD1000000010_S0000081 YEAH THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THEY ESTIMATE IT'S NOW REACHED OVER A MILLION STUDENTS
POD1000000010_S0000082 IN FACT IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO TREAT EACH OTHER
POD1000000010_S0000083 YEAH AND NOT JUST TO PREVENT THE NEXT TRAGEDY BUT ALSO BECAUSE RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THESE NON ACADEMIC SKILLS OFTEN CALLED SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS
POD1000000010_S0000084 THEY MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE EQUATION THAT DETERMINES WHETHER KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LIVES
POD1000000010_S0000085 SO LET'S FOLLOW SCARLETT'S LEAD AND SESAME STREET'S AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE OF KINDNESS CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000087 TAKE AWAY NUMBER TWO
POD1000000010_S0000088 KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000089 BUT ALSO UNKIND
POD1000000010_S0000090 HERE'S WHAT WE MEAN
POD1000000010_S0000091 SO ON THE ONE HAND PEOPLE HAVE NEURONS IN OUR BRAINS CALLED MIRROR NEURONS AND THEY RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PAIN LIKE WHAT PRICKED BY A NEEDLE AS WE DO WHEN WE WATCH SOMEONE ELSE EXPERIENCE PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000092 IT'S A MIRROR
POD1000000010_S0000093 IT LIGHTS UP THE SAME RECEPTORS IN OUR BRAIN AS PHYSICAL PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000094 SOON AFTER BIRTH CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO CRY AS A RESULT OF HEARING ANOTHER CHILD CRY THAN THEY ARE IN RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER SORT OF NOISE
POD1000000010_S0000095 THOMAS LACUNA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS EVEN IN TINY BABIES
POD1000000010_S0000096 HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WROTE THE BOOK ON HOW TO RAISE KIND KIDS LITERALLY
POD1000000010_S0000097 THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED HE'S ALSO BEEN A FAMILY COUNSELOR HAS TWO KIDS AND 15 GRAND KIDS
POD1000000010_S0000098 AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABIES MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER
POD1000000010_S0000099 STUDIES GOING BACK TO THE LATE 1990S HAVE FOUND INFANTS AS YOUNG AS 3 MONTHS OLD PREFER A KIND OR HELPER PUPPET OVER A MEAN AGGRESSIVE CHARACTER
POD1000000010_S0000100 SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING CORY I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE
POD1000000010_S0000101 YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM FOR KIDS IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF BARRIERS TO KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000102 FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SMALL STUDY OF TWO YEAR OLDS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER CHILD'S DISTRESS SAY A FRIEND FELL DOWN ON THE PLAYGROUND
POD1000000010_S0000103 ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM WITH KINDNESS BY SAY GOING OVER TO THE CHILD OFFERING A HUG CALLING FOR AN ADULT
POD1000000010_S0000104 
POD1000000010_S0000106 HE'S TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000107 HE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT
POD1000000010_S0000108 YEAH AND WE ACTUALLY SAW THIS KIND OF SEEN IN PERSON ON A RECENT TRIP THAT WE TOOK TO A PRESCHOOL ON THE CAMPUS OF EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY
POD1000000010_S0000109 
POD1000000010_S0000110 GREAT LET'S SEE
POD1000000010_S0000111 WHAT A KIND FRIENDS
POD1000000010_S0000112 LET ME
POD1000000010_S0000114 AND IT REALLY GOT ME WONDERING WOULD MY KIDS BE THAT 1 IN 3 WOULD YOURS
POD1000000010_S0000115 YEAH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I REALLY HOPE SO
POD1000000010_S0000116 BUT WHAT IS IT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THAT KINDNESS THAT ACT OF KINDNESS IN THE MOMENT
POD1000000010_S0000117 A BUNCH OF THINGS
POD1000000010_S0000118 YOUNG KIDS ARE NATURALLY
POD1000000010_S0000119 SURE
POD1000000010_S0000120 EVERY PARENT KNOWS THAT
POD1000000010_S0000121 SO THEY MIGHT JUST BE OBLIVIOUS TO ANOTHER CHILD'S PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000122 YOU KNOW AND THERE'S ALSO INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT
POD1000000010_S0000123 SO SOME KIDS
POD1000000010_S0000124 THEY REALLY CAN'T HANDLE OTHER KIDS PAIN THEY SHUT DOWN
POD1000000010_S0000125 OR MAYBE THEY'RE REALLY SHY AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO STEP UP
POD1000000010_S0000126 YOU KNOW DECADES OF PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH TELLS US THIS IS A GROWN UP PROBLEM TOO
POD1000000010_S0000127 SOMETIMES THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY SERVES AS AN INHIBITION
POD1000000010_S0000128 BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER MORE DISTURBING BARRIER TO KINDNESS THAT ADULTS REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HERE AND IT'S PREJUDICE
POD1000000010_S0000129 SO THERE'S ANOTHER YALE STUDY OF SIX TO EIGHT MONTH OLD BABY
POD1000000010_S0000130 
POD1000000010_S0000131 THEY WANTED A PUPPET THAT DID NOT SHARE THEIR SNACK PREFERENCE PUNISHED
POD1000000010_S0000132 PUNISHED
POD1000000010_S0000133 YEAH SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT THESE BABIES SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK OR BEHAVE OR THINK LIKE THEY DO BUT ALSO KIND OF HOSTILITY TO THOSE THAT DON'T
POD1000000010_S0000134 WOW
POD1000000010_S0000135 YEAH SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS CHILDREN AND GROWN UPS ALIKE DON'T ALWAYS REACH OUT TO HELP
POD1000000010_S0000136 INSTEAD WE OFTEN DO THE OPPOSITE
POD1000000010_S0000137 IT'S TRUE WE HIDE FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S PEE IN WE RUN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY
POD1000000010_S0000138 AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000139 YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THE SKILLS AND TOOLS
POD1000000010_S0000140 WHAT YOU NEED IS THE COURAGE TO BE WITH SOMEBODY IN PAIN AND JUST BE PRESENT
POD1000000010_S0000142 AND THAT'S OUR THIRD TAKEAWAY
POD1000000010_S0000143 KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000144 THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000145 AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000146 WHEN THE SHOOTER STOPPED TO RELOAD HE YELLED RUN AND THE INVESTIGATOR SAID THAT HE SAVED MANY OF HIS CLASSMATES LIVES IN THAT MOMENT
POD1000000010_S0000147 YEAH AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000149 COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000151 HEROIC COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000152 FOR HER IT INCLUDES THE COURAGE TO REACH OUT TO A HURTING FRIEND ON THE PLAYGROUND OR OR A CHILD YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
POD1000000010_S0000153 YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE COURAGE TO OFFER COMFORT TO SOMEONE WHO'S LOST A LOVED ONE EVEN IF THE IDEA OF DEATH IS REALLY SCARY TO YOU
POD1000000010_S0000154 IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES
POD1000000010_S0000155 GOSH YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU ACT THAT WAY
POD1000000010_S0000156 WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE
POD1000000010_S0000157 I FEEL COMPASSION FOR YOU
POD1000000010_S0000158 I SEE THE PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000159 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO HELP EASE THAT PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000160 YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE AND THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME CORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS
POD1000000010_S0000161 I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH
POD1000000010_S0000162 I MEAN SOMEONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT I AS A PARENT FEAR SO MUCH AND TO LOOK THAT PAIN IN THE FACE
POD1000000010_S0000163 BUT THE WAY THAT SHE HAS TRANSFORMED THAT EXPERIENCE INTO A POSITIVE LEGACY IS SO INSPIRING
POD1000000010_S0000165 ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETS CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM
POD1000000010_S0000166 THEY PRACTICE BRAVE POSES AND BRAVE BREATHS TO STAND UP TALL LIKE SUPERHEROES AND CALM DOWN THEIR BODIES AND THEIR MINDS
POD1000000010_S0000167 YEAH THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS WHICH MAKE UP OUR FOURTH TAKE
POD1000000010_S0000168 GOT TAKE AWAY NUMBER FOUR
POD1000000010_S0000169 KINDNESS TAKES MINDFULNESS
POD1000000010_S0000170 JEN KOTLER AT SESAME SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S
POD1000000010_S0000171 AND YOU'LL BE LESS LIKELY TO LASH OUT VIOLENTLY AND FRUSTRATION OR ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000172 SELF REGULATION IS SOMETHING WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH
POD1000000010_S0000173 AND THAT'S WHY MINDFULNESS IS SO IMPORTANT AND REALLY LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE OUR OWN EMOTIONS
POD1000000010_S0000174 AND I THINK THE EARLIER THAT WE CAN PRACTICE THOSE SKILLS THE BETTER WILL BE IN ADULTHOOD
POD1000000010_S0000175 IN FACT THE FULL SESAME ARE SO CONVINCED OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND KINDNESS THAT THEY LIKE TO USE A SPECIAL WORD KINDFULNESS
POD1000000010_S0000176 YOU HEAR THAT MERRIAM WEBSTER
POD1000000010_S0000178 ANYWAY LOTS OF THESE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS INTRODUCED TOOLS LIKE MEDITATION RELAXATION YOGA TO HELP KIDS WORK ON THIS BODY MIND CONNECTION
POD1000000010_S0000179 SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE COURAGE THAT IT TAKES TO STEP IN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS HURTING EVEN IF THAT PERSON IS BEING HURTFUL TOWARDS YOU
POD1000000010_S0000180 AND HOW TO CULTIVATE THAT QUIET IN YOUR MIND THAT LET YOU DO THAT
POD1000000010_S0000181 OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY IS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR CHILD HURTS SOMEONE ELSE ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENTIONALLY
POD1000000010_S0000182 OR ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN SOMEONE ELSE HURTS YOUR CHILD
POD1000000010_S0000183 TAKE AWAY NUMBER 5
POD1000000010_S0000184 APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL
POD1000000010_S0000185 AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF
POD1000000010_S0000186 YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000010_S0000187 I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER BRIEFLY THAT WE WERE TOLD WE DON'T FORCE CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000010_S0000188 AND I REMEMBER IN MY EARLY 20S THINKING THAT'S ABSURD
POD1000000010_S0000189 YOU SHOULD TOTALLY TELL CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000010_S0000190 THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS
POD1000000010_S0000191 SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000192 THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MEAN IT YOU KNOW OR FEEL IT
POD1000000010_S0000193 YEAH SO TOM LACONIA AND JEN CUTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARENTING THE WORDS SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000194 WE SHOULD HELP THEM REALLY TAKE THE OTHER PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT REPAIR THE HARM DONE
POD1000000010_S0000195 YEAH AND THIS IS A GREAT
POD1000000010_S0000196 JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS
POD1000000010_S0000197 AND DIRECT ONE CHILD TO LOOK AT THE OTHER CHILD'S FACE AND
POD1000000010_S0000198 AND THIS HELPS THEM LEARN HOW TO READ FEELINGS
POD1000000010_S0000199 SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT MORE CONVERSATIONS AND ABOUT LOOKING AT EMOTIONS AND EMOTION KNOWLEDGE AND LOOKING AT FACES TO SEE HOW YOUR ACTIONS AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE
POD1000000010_S0000200 JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW
POD1000000010_S0000201 IT NOW HAS CHARACTERS DISCUSS WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY AND HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER
POD1000000010_S0000202 SO ELMO MIGHT SAY I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT
POD1000000010_S0000203 AND I REALIZED THAT YOU PROBABLY WANTED TO TURN TO
POD1000000010_S0000204 AND I SHOULD LET YOU HAVE THE TIME WITH IT
POD1000000010_S0000206 
POD1000000010_S0000207 BUT WAIT WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN ELMO
POD1000000010_S0000208 I CAN BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR THIS TURN
POD1000000010_S0000209 SO WHAT DO YOU SAY ZOE
POD1000000010_S0000210 AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTER WOULD SAY YES THAT'S HOW I WAS FEELING THAT YOU WEREN'T SHARING
POD1000000010_S0000211 AND IT WAS HURTING MY FEELINGS AND THEN WHEN YOU SHARED IT MADE ME FEEL BETTER
POD1000000010_S0000212 
POD1000000010_S0000214 ALL RIGHT LET'S JUMP SHARING ON
POD1000000010_S0000215 
POD1000000010_S0000216 SO IN THAT INTERACTION YOU'RE GIVING CHILDREN A LOT OF LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY'RE FEELING
POD1000000010_S0000217 THAT MAY BE A LOT TO EXPECT FROM A TWO YEAR OLD
POD1000000010_S0000218 BUT YOU KNOW APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL KIND OF LIKE LEARNING TO SCOOTER
POD1000000010_S0000219 AND THEY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE
POD1000000010_S0000220 YEAH AND STARTING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS EARLY IS CRUCIAL TO RAISING A CHILD WHO RUNS TO HELP WHEN SOMEBODY'S HURT
POD1000000010_S0000221 SO REMEMBER THAT SMALL STUDY WE MENTIONED OF KIDS ON THE PLAYGROUND
POD1000000010_S0000222 WELL IT ALSO LOOKED IN DEPTH AT THE PARENTING STYLES OF THEIR MOTHERS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
POD1000000010_S0000223 WHEN ONE CHILD HEARD ANOTHER MANY OF THE MOTHERS RESPONDED WITH SOMETHING CASUAL AND BLAND
POD1000000010_S0000224 YEAH LIKE OH DON'T DO THAT
POD1000000010_S0000225 BUT THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE MOMS OF THE HELPER KIDS THOSE ONE IN THREE WHO RAN TO HELP THEY WERE
POD1000000010_S0000226 YEAH THEY WERE WARM AND NURTURING BUT THEY ALSO TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEIR CHILD HURT ANOTHER
POD1000000010_S0000227 SO THEY'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE
POD1000000010_S0000228 YOU HURT AMY
POD1000000010_S0000229 PULLING HAIR HURTS NEVER PULL HAIR
POD1000000010_S0000230 AND AS A RESULT THE CHILD WAS MORE LIKELY TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY LATER ON AND RESPOND COMPASSIONATELY WHEN SHE SAW ANOTHER CHILD CRYING ON THE PLAYGROUND
POD1000000010_S0000231 TOM ALSO SAYS THE CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000232 WHAT WE GROWN UPS MIGHT CALL RESTITUTION IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING YOU FIX IT WHETHER IT'S A BROKEN TOY OR A HURT FEELING
POD1000000010_S0000233 THIS IS ALSO WHERE THINGS GET HARD FOR US GROWN UPS TOO
POD1000000010_S0000234 
POD1000000010_S0000235 BECAUSE ALL THE EXPERTS WE SPOKE WITH WERE REALLY CLEAR KIDS DO WHAT THEY SEE
POD1000000010_S0000236 AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS GREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO
POD1000000010_S0000237 WOW MOM MADE A MISTAKE YOU KNOW
POD1000000010_S0000238 AND I MISINTERPRETED WHAT JUST HAPPENED
POD1000000010_S0000239 AND I GOT ANGRY I'M SORRY YOU KNOW CAN YOU GUYS FORGIVE ME
POD1000000010_S0000240 IF ANYTHING SCARLET TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000241 THAT'S ONE OF THE FOUR CORE VALUES OF HER CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM ALONG WITH COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000242 SHE SAYS WHEN SHE FIRST PITCHED THE PROGRAM PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000243 THAT'S A VERY LOFTY TOPIC FOR KIDS
POD1000000010_S0000244 DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED
POD1000000010_S0000245 NOT AT ALL SHE SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000246 THE CHOOSE LOVE CLASSROOMS HAVE TURNED FORGIVENESS INTO A HANDS ON EXERCISE
POD1000000010_S0000247 WE LITERALLY TAKE STRING AND SCISSORS AND WE CUT THE CORD BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I TALK ABOUT
POD1000000010_S0000248 LIKE IF YOU'RE ANGRY AT SOMEBODY YOU'RE ATTACHED TO THEM WITH AN UMBILICAL
POD1000000010_S0000249 AND IT RUNS OUT OF YOUR SIDE INTO THE SIDE OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT
POD1000000010_S0000250 I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000251 AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW HOLDING ON TO HER ANGER IT CAN BE AS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AS SMOKING CIGARETTES
POD1000000010_S0000252 AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WE'RE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO HER REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSIE AND HER OTHER SON JT AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK
POD1000000010_S0000253 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000254 DID SHE FORGIVE THE PERSON WHO MURDERED HER SON
POD1000000010_S0000255 ABSOLUTELY
POD1000000010_S0000257 WITHOUT HESITATION YEAH I WITHOUT HESITATION I ABSOLUTELY FORGIVE HIM
POD1000000010_S0000259 SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KINDNESS IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE MOMENTS OF CONFLICT
POD1000000010_S0000260 LOSS AND PAIN HURT AND ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000261 AND THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
POD1000000010_S0000262 I MEAN THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY NEED KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000263 YEAH BUT HOW DO YOU BUILD KINDNESS UP
POD1000000010_S0000264 WELL IF YOU WANT TO REALLY GROW KIND PEOPLE THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD WHEN YOU ARE FULL OF JOY
POD1000000010_S0000265 THAT'S OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER 6 KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT
POD1000000010_S0000266 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT
POD1000000010_S0000267 YOU HAVE TO RAISE THE CAPITAL OF KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000268 I JUST SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA
POD1000000010_S0000269 AND SHE FOCUSED A LOT ON KINDNESS WHEN SHE TAUGHT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
POD1000000010_S0000270 YOU HAVE TO POINT IT OUT
POD1000000010_S0000271 YOU HAVE TO NAME IT
POD1000000010_S0000272 YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT
POD1000000010_S0000273 FOR EXAMPLE EVERY DAY SHE'D HOLD CIRCLE TIME
POD1000000010_S0000274 AND A LOT OF TIMES SHE'D ASK THIS
POD1000000010_S0000275 YOU KNOW WHAT WERE SOME WAYS THIS WEEK WHERE YOUR CLASSMATES WERE KIND TO YOU
POD1000000010_S0000276 TURN AND SHARE A MOMENT WHERE YOU FELT SOMEONE WAS BEING REALLY KIND
POD1000000010_S0000277 TOM LACUNAE SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS
POD1000000010_S0000278 IT'S ENCOURAGING KIDS TO IDENTIFY AS KIND PEOPLE
POD1000000010_S0000279 YEAH BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE KIND IF THEY SEE IT AS PART OF WHO THEY ARE
POD1000000010_S0000280 YEAH THIS IDEA OF TAKING SPECIAL NOTICE WHEN PEOPLE ARE KIND TO YOU WELL ANOTHER WORD FOR THAT COULD BE GRATITUDE
POD1000000010_S0000281 YEAH PART OF HOUSE GARLIC KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR
POD1000000010_S0000282 MY GRATITUDE LIST ARE ALL DAY LONG
POD1000000010_S0000283 AND I START IN THE MORNING BY TAKING OFF UP THE SUN'S OUT UP I CAN GET UP OUT OF BED AND LITERALLY LIKE I'M TAKING THEM OFF ALL DAY
POD1000000010_S0000284 AND WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON GRATITUDE YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE LESSER ENERGY THOUGHTS
POD1000000010_S0000285 AND TOM AGREE
POD1000000010_S0000286 THERE'S A PAYOFF TO PRACTICING GRATITUDE IN THIS
POD1000000010_S0000287 NOT ONLY CAN IT RAISE THE STOCK OF KINDNESS IN YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR CLASSROOM BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE THANKFUL ARE ALSO HAPPIER
POD1000000010_S0000288 YEAH HE SUGGESTS THAT IT MEAL TIMES FOR EXAMPLE FAMILIES GO AROUND AND MENTION THEIR GRATEFULNESS THINGS THAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR THAT DAY
POD1000000010_S0000289 YEAH WE DO THIS IN MY HOUSE

POD1000000010_S0000305 PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE
POD1000000010_S0000306 YEAH IN FACT SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000307 WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE NAME OF OUR PROGRAM FROM CHOOSE LOVE AND RICHMOND PROGRAM TO CHOOSE LOVE AND RICHMOND PRACTICE
POD1000000010_S0000308 AND SIMILARLY TOM SAYS KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM IT'S A HABIT
POD1000000010_S0000309 AND THAT'S NOT JUST CALLING OUT KINDNESS WHEN YOU SEE IT IN YOUR KIDS
POD1000000010_S0000310 IT'S GIVING THEM LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000311 YOU CAN START WITH CHORES AT HOME
POD1000000010_S0000312 CHORES YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
POD1000000010_S0000313 SO TOM SAYS YOU KNOW NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
POD1000000010_S0000314 AND FOR MY DAUGHTER LULU WHO 7 THAT CHORE REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT
POD1000000010_S0000315 YOU KNOW MAYBE GOT THE CAT SHE PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD HELP OUT NOT ONLY WITH THE FEEDING BUT ALSO THE LITTER BOX
POD1000000010_S0000316 THIS IS REALLY GIVING HER THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER CREATURE DEPENDING ON HER
POD1000000010_S0000317 YEAH TOTALLY
POD1000000010_S0000318 AND YOU CAN ALSO AND SHOULD YOU KNOW TAKE THIS MODEL THIS IDEA AND TAKE IT OUT INTO YOUR COMMUNITY
POD1000000010_S0000319 YOU KNOW I HAVE YOUR KIDS HELP PICK UP TRASH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR HELP FOLKS AT A SHELTER
POD1000000010_S0000320 RAISE MONEY FOR A GOOD CAUSE WHATEVER IT IS
POD1000000010_S0000322 AND HERE'S A REALLY GOOD NEWS TOM TOLD US
POD1000000010_S0000323 GETTING OUR KIDS TO BE HELPERS TO BE IN SERVICE IT DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT THE GROWN UPS THAT THEY BECOME
POD1000000010_S0000324 DOING THIS REGULARLY ACTUALLY FEELS GOOD CHEMICALLY
POD1000000010_S0000325 THAT'S WHAT BRAIN RESEARCHERS CALL HELPERS HI
POD1000000010_S0000326 DOING A KIND ACT LIGHTS UP A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT LETS US EXPERIENCE JOY
POD1000000010_S0000327 AND THAT'S WHY HE SAYS WE'RE HAPPIER WHEN WERE HELPING AND JANET SESAME AGREES
POD1000000010_S0000328 KINDNESS REALLY DOES MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD
POD1000000010_S0000329 AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS WE SHOULD TALK TO KIDS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS HELPERS HI
POD1000000010_S0000330 THERE'S SO MUCH SCIENCE THAT SHOWS AND I SAY ALL THE NURTURING HEALING LOVE THAT YOU GIVE OUT YOU GET BACK
POD1000000010_S0000331 SO THIS IS GETTING ME THINKING MORE ABOUT THAT STUDY OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WE OPENED THE EPISODE
POD1000000010_S0000332 HMM
POD1000000010_S0000333 YOU KNOW OUR KIDS THEY HEAR FROM US EVERY DAY DO YOUR HOMEWORK
POD1000000010_S0000334 STUDY FOR THE
POD1000000010_S0000335 HOW WELL DID YOU DO
POD1000000010_S0000336 AND THEY HEAR US TALK ABOUT SWEATING SOME PROMOTION OR WORKING HARD ON A PROJECT
POD1000000010_S0000337 BUT YOU KNOW DO WE EVER STOP AND ASK THEM WHERE YOU KIND IN CLASS TODAY
POD1000000010_S0000338 YEAH DID YOU HELP SOMEBODY WHO IS HURTING OR SIT BY THAT KID WHO ALWAYS EATS ALONE
POD1000000010_S0000339 IT'S NO WONDER OUR KIDS SO OFTEN THINK THAT WE VALUE GRADES MORE THAN KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000340 SO I'M THINKING MORE ABOUT HOW TO RAISE THE CAPITAL KINDNESS AT
POD1000000010_S0000341 AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE GREAT STRATEGIES RIGHT
POD1000000010_S0000342 YEAH I MEAN THE GOAL HERE EVERYONE WE TALKED TO SAID THIS SAID THIS
POD1000000010_S0000343 THEY USE THE WORD CULTURE
POD1000000010_S0000344 YOU HAVE TO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOME OR THE CLASSROOM OR
POD1000000010_S0000346 TIME FOR A RECAP ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000347 ALL RIGHT I'M FEELIN THE LOVE LET'S DO IT

POD1000000010_S0000349 HERE WE GO TAKE AWAY NUMBER ONE
POD1000000010_S0000350 WE GROWN UPS NEED TO STOP SENDING OUR KIDS MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS
POD1000000010_S0000351 YEAH WE SAY WE WANT OUR KIDS TO BE KIND BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WALK THE WALK
POD1000000010_S0000352 TAKE AWAY NUMBER TWO KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND BUT ALSO UNCOVER
POD1000000010_S0000353 YES SO EMPATHY IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US HUMAN BUT IN THIS IS A BIG BUTT
POD1000000010_S0000354 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEELING SOMEONE ELSE'S PAIN AND ACTUALLY ACTING TO HELP
POD1000000010_S0000355 YEAH KINDNESS IS NOT JUST A FEELING IT'S AN ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000356 AND THAT'S WHY OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE IS KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000357 THE COURAGE TO EMBRACE OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN THE COURAGE TO PUT OTHER PEOPLE'S NEEDS BEFORE YOUR OWN
POD1000000010_S0000358 BUT ALSO COURAGE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S HURT YOU OR A FRIEND OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY NOT AS A BULLY
POD1000000010_S0000359 BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S STRUGGLING
POD1000000010_S0000360 THE KIND OF COURAGE TO SEE THE WORLD THE WAY SCARLET LEWIS DOES
POD1000000010_S0000361 THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE IN PAIN
POD1000000010_S0000362 TAKE AWAY NUMBER FOR TO BUILD KINDNESS PRACTICE MINDFULNESS
POD1000000010_S0000363 BEING ABLE TO STAY CALM AND PATIENT WILL HELP YOU EVERY TIME
POD1000000010_S0000364 ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOU
POD1000000010_S0000365 SO TAKE AWAY NUMBER FIVE IS APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF
POD1000000010_S0000366 REMEMBER PARENTS AND TEACHERS ALIKE THE OLD SING SONGY SORRY IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
POD1000000010_S0000367 AND WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HARM FORGIVENESS MAY FEEL HARD BUT IT WILL ALSO FEEL GOOD IN THE LONG RUN
POD1000000010_S0000368 SPEAKING OF FEELING GOOD OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX IS KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT
POD1000000010_S0000369 OR AS JEN AT SESAME SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000370 WE OFTEN ARE QUICK TO TELL CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND TRYING TO CORRECT THEM FROM DOING SOMETHING WRONG
POD1000000010_S0000371 INSTEAD CAN WE SPEND MORE TIME CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING RIGHT CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING KIND
POD1000000010_S0000372 SO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE RECOGNITION OF KINDNESS IN YOUR HOME AND IN YOUR

POD1000000014_S0000014 WHERE WERE YOU BORN AND TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WERE INSTILLED IN YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP
POD1000000014_S0000015 THANK YOU ROSE BUT I WAS BORN IN DUBLIN I WAS BORN INTO A FAIRLY ORDINARY WORKING CLASS HUH
POD1000000014_S0000016 MY DAD WAS A MECHANIC WITH THE STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY MY MOTHER WAS AS WAS THE CASE WITH MANY IN THE DAY A HOUSEWIFE
POD1000000014_S0000017 WE LIVED A VERY ORDINARY FAMILY LIFE
POD1000000014_S0000018 I DIDN'T ENJOY SCHOOL I WAS TAUGHT BY THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS SO I HAVE SOME OF MY LEARNING TO THANK THEM FOR
POD1000000014_S0000019 AND SAY THEY CONTRIBUTED TO A VERY HAPPY SCHOOL DAYS BUT THE REST OF MY CHILDHOOD WAS VERY ENJOYABLE SO
POD1000000014_S0000020 MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE RELIGIOUS IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT IRELAND AT THE TIME
POD1000000014_S0000021 OUR HOUSE WAS BUSY THERE WERE OFTEN RELATIVES OR NEIGHBORS POPPING IN FOUR CUPS OF TEA
POD1000000014_S0000022 AND SO IT WAS THAT PLEASANT PLACE TO GROW UP
POD1000000014_S0000023 SO YOU HAD A COMMUNITY SERVICE BACKGROUND BEFORE GOING TO WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT THAT'S GREAT ISN'T IT
POD1000000014_S0000024 YES I WORKED FOR THE WELCH HOUSING AGENCY WHEN IT WAS SET UP THAT WAS FUNDING HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS ON SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING
POD1000000014_S0000025 BUT THEN I WENT TO WORK FOR CARD IS HOUSING DEPARTMENT
POD1000000014_S0000026 I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND SHELTERED HOUSING FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND SO ON
POD1000000014_S0000027 AND ALSO MANAGE THE GYPSY SITES IN CARDIFF SO VERY INTERESTING JOB
POD1000000014_S0000028 BUT I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE INVOLVED IN MAINSTREAM HOUSING THROUGH THAT
POD1000000014_S0000029 AND THEN BEFORE YOU BECAME WELSH OMBUDSMAN YOU WERE YOU WERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ARTS COUNCIL OF WALES WAS IT WAS THAT GOOD FUN
POD1000000014_S0000030 IT WAS VERY GOOD FUN IT WAS AT A TIME SHORTLY AFTER THE CREATION OF THE WELSH ASSEMBLY
POD1000000014_S0000031 GOVERNMENT IN WALES WAS INTERESTED IN NATION BUILDING IF YOU LIKE DOING THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THEY SAW THE ARTS AS A VALUABLE WAY OF DOING THAT
POD1000000014_S0000032 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN COMMUNITY ARTS AND ARTS OUTREACH TO PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE EXCLUDED
POD1000000014_S0000033 SO IT'S FITTED VERY WELL FOR ME I NEVER HAD ANY EXPERTISE IN THE ARTS BUT I GREATLY ENJOYED IT
POD1000000014_S0000034 IT WAS A VERY GOOD TIME FOR THE ARTS IN WALES
POD1000000014_S0000035 NOW I THINK YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE OCCUPIED NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN JOBS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000014_S0000036 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANYONE ELSE LIKE YOU IN THAT REGARD BUT WHAT WAS IT LIKE MOVING FROM BEING ON BATSMAN IN WALES TO OMBUDSMAN IN IN IRELAND
POD1000000014_S0000037 IT WAS INTERESTING
POD1000000014_S0000038 I THINK THE OMBUDSMAN IN WALES WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATION IN WALES
POD1000000014_S0000039 BUT PARTICULARLY THE WORK FOCUSED WITHIN THE HEALTH SPHERE
POD1000000014_S0000040 AND AN AWFUL LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE DEALT WITH WHERE TO DO WITH CLINICAL
POD1000000014_S0000041 SO MOVING TO IRELAND AND FIRSTLY I FOUND THAT I DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER CLINICAL JUDGMENT
POD1000000014_S0000042 BUT ALSO I HAVE JURISDICTION OVER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND LOCAL
POD1000000014_S0000043 SO IT WAS SIMILAR IN SOME WAYS TO WELLS BUT IT WAS A BIGGER JOB IF YOU
POD1000000014_S0000044 IN THE CONTEXT OF A WHOLE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES TO DEAL WITH
POD1000000014_S0000045 IN IRELAND YOU'RE ALSO WEAR MANY HATS YOU'RE ALSO THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000014_S0000046 AND YOU DEAL WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AS WELL
POD1000000014_S0000047 IS THAT DEFINE THAT AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF BEING ON THE
POD1000000014_S0000048 IT'S VERY HELPFUL IF YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THE SAME KINDS OF PRINCIPLES YOU'RE COMMITTED TO GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES YOU'RE COMMITTED TO OPENNESS YOU COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY
POD1000000014_S0000049 THOSE VALUES WORK ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HATS I WEAR
POD1000000014_S0000050 I SUPPOSE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS AS OMBUDSMAN YOU MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IN IRELAND IN THE HISTORY OF THE OFFICE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
POD1000000014_S0000051 AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER YOU MAKE BINDING DECISIONS BUT THOSE GET CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS
POD1000000014_S0000052 DESPITE WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK TO BE THE CASE BEING AN OMBUDSMAN IN SOME WAYS IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF HAVING OUTCOMES ACHIEVED THAN HAVING BINDING POWERS AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000014_S0000053 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO YOU AS IRISH
POD1000000014_S0000054 YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN REAPPOINTED FOR A SECOND TERM BUT LOOKING BACK ON THE SIX YEARS THAT YOU'VE HAD WHAT WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES
POD1000000014_S0000055 THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACED WAS WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAGDALENE LAUNDRIES
POD1000000014_S0000056 AS WE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES THERE THIS IS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL
POD1000000014_S0000057 OFTEN YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAD BABIES SOMETIMES SCHOOL CHILDREN BEING HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL AND FORCED TO WORK FOR MANY YEARS IN LAUNDRIES
POD1000000014_S0000058 WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION SCHEME AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD CHOSEN TO INTERPRET THAT SCHEME VERY NARROWLY
POD1000000014_S0000059 SO THEY WERE EXCLUDING YOUNG WOMEN PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME WE'RE YOUNG WOMEN AND HAD WORKED IN THE LAUNDRIES BUT BEING DETAINED IN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS
POD1000000014_S0000060 SHARED THE SAME SITES AS THE LAUNDRIES BUT NOT TECHNICALLY RESIDENT IN THE LAUNDRY
POD1000000014_S0000061 SO WE LOOKED AT THAT AND FELT THAT THERE WAS A HUGE INJUSTICE BUT THE INITIAL RESPONSE OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS TO REJECT OUR FINDINGS
POD1000000014_S0000062 SO THAT REQUIRED A HIGH PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GOVERNMENT CHANGING ITS MIND
POD1000000014_S0000063 TO BE FAIR I SUSPECT IF MINISTERS HAD BEEN INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET I DON'T THINK THAT THE REJECTION WE INITIALLY SAW WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
POD1000000014_S0000064 DID ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE THIS DETRIMENT GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU OR WAS THIS A NATURE OF NEW SEEING THE UNFAIRNESS AND ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF
POD1000000014_S0000065 NO WE HAD A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES BUT WE INVESTIGATED THE WHOLE SCHEME SO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE KNOWN OF MY OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000066 SO THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE TO AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000014_S0000067 YES IT IS YOU CAN INVESTIGATE
POD1000000014_S0000068 EVEN IF YOU GET COMPLAINTS SOMETIMES YOU ARE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY INVESTIGATE ON THE FACTS IF YOU CAN'T UNDERTAKE ON AN ETCHED OF INVESTIGATIONS
POD1000000014_S0000069 SOMETHING COMES UP THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THERE'S NO CONSTRAINTS ON ME LOOKING AT THAT
POD1000000014_S0000070 I'M PARTICULARLY I'VE FOUND THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF EXCLUDED GROUPS IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL TO USE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T COME TO YOU CAN NONETHELESS HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE
POD1000000014_S0000071 IS THAT REGARDED AS CONTROVERSIAL IN IRELAND I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SO
POD1000000014_S0000072 I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST PART OF THE TOOLKIT AVAILABLE TO THE OFFICE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY GIVES IT ANY SECOND THOUGHT
POD1000000014_S0000073 NOW YOU BEHAVE VERY BRAVELY AND IN THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE AT ONE POINT WHEN YOU WERE BEING BLOCKED BY MINISTERS YOU THREATENED TO GO TO THE
POD1000000014_S0000075 IS THAT RIGHT
POD1000000014_S0000076 WHEN I WAS BIG BLUFF BY OFFICIALS I WENT TO THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND THREW HIM TO THE
POD1000000014_S0000078 THE PRIME MINISTER
POD1000000014_S0000079 I ASKED THAT THEY PERSONALLY LOOK TO RESOLVE THE MATTER BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A STARK INJUSTICE AND REFLECTED VERY POORLY ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND
POD1000000014_S0000081 CAN THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE BOTH ACTED WITH GREAT EXPEDIENCY AND THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THEIR INTERVENTION
POD1000000014_S0000082 I DIDN'T THINK YOU CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT HAVING THE KIND OF GUTS THAT YOU'VE SHOWN THROUGHOUT THIS
POD1000000014_S0000083 AND I HOPE YOU WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE OMBUDSMAN THAT DON'T HAVE OWN INITIATIVE POWERS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GREAT CAMP
POD1000000014_S0000084 HOW DO YOU THINK IT IS I MEAN EVEN IN A WELCH CONTEXT WHERE I DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THE TIME
POD1000000014_S0000085 YOU COULD BE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING IN ONE HEALTH BOARD AND SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE ARISING ELSEWHERE
POD1000000014_S0000086 BUT TECHNICALLY YOU COULDN'T EXTEND YOUR INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE BODY YOU WERE
POD1000000014_S0000087 DOES ABILITY TO EXTEND AN INVESTIGATION TO COVER WHICHEVER BODIES ARE INVOLVED IS VERY POWERFUL
POD1000000014_S0000088 SO A LOT OF MY WORK LET'S SAY WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES IN ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
POD1000000014_S0000089 I WILL BE LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS THAT ARE TO DO WITH HEALTHCARE THAT ARE TO DO WITH ACCESS TO BENEFITS THAT ARE TO DO WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS ACCESS TO HOUSING
POD1000000014_S0000090 OTHER THAN THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN PROVIDING THE ACCOMMODATION
POD1000000014_S0000091 SO IT IS JUST THAT CAPACITY TO BROADEN OUT AN INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY TO INSTIGATE AN INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE COMPLAINTS
POD1000000014_S0000092 NOW MY CURRENT INITIATIVE INVESTIGATION IS LOOKING AT THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE UNDER 65 LIVING IN NURSING HOMES
POD1000000014_S0000093 THAT'S BECOME A MUCH MORE PRESSING ISSUE IN THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE INTERVIEWED HAS ALREADY DIED AND ANOTHER HAS CONTRACTED THE VIRUS
POD1000000014_S0000094 SO ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION
POD1000000014_S0000095 WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WRITTEN TO THE LEADERS OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN TALKS LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT
POD1000000014_S0000096 TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE SO THAT AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TODAY TO IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION CAN HOPEFULLY HELP TO SHAPE THE POLICIES OF THE INCOMING GOVERNMENT
POD1000000014_S0000097 CAN WE JUST MOVE ON A LITTLE BIT
POD1000000014_S0000098 YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTE WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND PRESTIGIOUS JOB WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE TO OMBUDSMAN ALL OVER THE WORLD
POD1000000014_S0000099 WELL I DID VALUE DO YOU THINK THE IOI BRINGS TO TO OUR DISCUSSIONS
POD1000000014_S0000100 I THINK ONE OF THE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT STRAIGHTFORWARDLY LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER
POD1000000014_S0000101 BEING AN OMBUDSMAN IS NECESSARILY AN ISOLATED ROLL WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IS BE TOO CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SERVICES WHICH ARE WITHIN YOUR JURISDICTION
POD1000000014_S0000102 SO CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER THAN WE DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHOSE SERVICES WERE LOOKING AT AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER IS VERY IMPORTANT
POD1000000014_S0000103 THE II PROVIDES STRUCTURED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE VERY VALUABLE THINGS WE'VE DONE
POD1000000014_S0000104 IT PROVIDES BEST PRACTICE PAPERS TO SHOW HOW THINGS CAN BEST BE
POD1000000014_S0000105 AND THEN OF COURSE ROB YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEST PRACTICE PAPER ON ON PEER REVIEW AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THAT FIELD
POD1000000014_S0000106 BUT ALSO I THINK THE IOI HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN SUPPORTING OMBUDSMAN ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THREAT
POD1000000014_S0000107 WE'VE SEEN FOR INSTANCE COLLEAGUES IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB ARE BEING THREATENED OR IGNORED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT
POD1000000014_S0000108 AND WE'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE BUDGETS BEING CUT AND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE BEING DENOUNCED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND SO ON
POD1000000014_S0000109 SO THE SOLIDARITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO INTERVENE QUITE DIRECTLY
POD1000000014_S0000110 GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF CYPRUS WHERE THE AUDITOR GENERAL WAS LOOKING TO INTERFERE IN THE WORK OF THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000111 FOLLOWING INTERVENTION FROM THE IOWA AND OTHERS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS AND THE PARLIAMENT IN PARTICULAR THE THREATS WERE WITHDRAWN
POD1000000014_S0000112 IN POLAND'S THE OMBUDSMAN WAS THREATENED WITH LARGE CUTS TO ITS BUDGET WE SENT IN A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY
POD1000000014_S0000113 WE INTERVIEWED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS WE INTERVIEWED THE JUDICIARY
POD1000000014_S0000114 WE CARRIED OUT PRESS CONFERENCES WE TALKED TO NGOS AND WE MANAGED TO GET A STAY OF EXECUTION
POD1000000014_S0000115 SO WE SAW MAJOR THREATS TO DEMOCRACY THERE BUT OUR INTERVENTION ALONG WITH THOSE OF OTHERS HAS HELPED TO ENSURE THAT THAT OFFICE IS STILL THERE AND IS CONTINUED TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY
POD1000000014_S0000116 POLICE INTERVENTION WAS CRUCIAL
POD1000000014_S0000117 AND WHAT'S ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT IT WAS THAT YOU ACTUALLY WENT THERE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT
POD1000000014_S0000118 BUT YOU PUT THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PRESSURE BY ASKING THEM TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING
POD1000000014_S0000119 ABSOLUTELY SO WE DID THAT HIM PERSON AND WE DID IT THROUGH THE MEDIA SO THAT IT HAD A VERY HIGH PROFILE WITHIN POLAND I THINK IT'S IT'S NO GOOD
POD1000000014_S0000120 I DID THE SAME INSIGHT FOR THIS MEDIA INTERVIEWS TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND
POD1000000014_S0000121 I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT SOLIDARITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT COMES JUST IN THE FORM OF THE LETTER THOUGH SOMETIMES THE LATTER CAN BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IN ITSELF
POD1000000014_S0000122 BUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY SCALE THE INTERVENTION TO THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE
POD1000000014_S0000123 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A LOT WHEN WE'VE NOT BEEN ON THE RADIO BUT
POD1000000014_S0000124 HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT WE AS OMBUDS DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICAL MATTERS
POD1000000014_S0000125 OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS A CULTURAL RELIC OF BRITISH IMPERIALISM
POD1000000014_S0000127 BUT I'VE READ THAT BRITISH IMPERIALISM NO I THINK IT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION
POD1000000014_S0000128 I THINK THAT FOR AN OMBUDSMAN NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS OVERSEEING SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE STATE
POD1000000014_S0000129 AND SO THEREFORE ANY COMMENT WE MAKE ON THOSE SERVICES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE POLITICAL
POD1000000014_S0000130 BUT WE CAN'T BE AS PARTY POLITICAL AND WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS SPEAK BEYOND THE EVIDENCE OF OUR CASE
POD1000000014_S0000131 SO I TALKED EARLIER ON ABOUT SEEKING TO AFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND TO TO PROMOTE PARTICULAR POLICIES TO FAVOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF PEOPLE
POD1000000014_S0000132 BUT I'M DOING THAT ON THE BASIS OF INVESTIGATIONS I'M CARRYING OUT
POD1000000014_S0000133 I'M NOT DOING IT AS PETER TYNDALL'S CITIZEN I'M DOING IT AS OMBUDSMAN OF OUR LAND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE FROM MY CASE BOOK
POD1000000014_S0000134 UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO INTERVENE
POD1000000014_S0000135 I THINK IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IF PEOPLE ARE SEEN TO BE INTERVENING ON ISSUES WHICH GO BEYOND THEIR OWN WORK AS
POD1000000014_S0000136 I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC
POD1000000014_S0000137 BUT I DO THINK THAT IF YOU'VE GOT EVIDENCE THEN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE THAT EVIDENCE WHERE IT CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO YOU
POD1000000014_S0000138 SO WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS THE END BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW YOU'RE COPING WITH THE CORONAVIRUS
POD1000000014_S0000139 WHAT SORT OF IMPACT HAS IT HAD SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM ON THE WAY YOU OPERATE
POD1000000014_S0000140 THAT'S AN INTERESTING ONE
POD1000000014_S0000141 OF THE THE FIRST THING WAS THAT WE SURPRISED OURSELVES BY BEING ABLE TO GET OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO WORK REMOTELY MUCH QUICKER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE OTHERWISE
POD1000000014_S0000142 I SUPPOSE IF IT'S PROVED ANYTHING IT'S THAT WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS IT'S SURPRISING HOW LONG TERM PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED IN A HURRY
POD1000000014_S0000143 SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE ALL OF OUR SERVICES MORE OR LESS WITHOUT CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE
POD1000000014_S0000144 WE'VE HAD SOME CHANGES IN VOLUMES OF WORK COMING TO US
POD1000000014_S0000145 WE PUT A BIT MORE EMPHASIS ON PROJECT WORK BUT BY AND LARGE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR COMPLAINTS TO
POD1000000014_S0000146 THEY CAN RING US THEY CAN EMAIL US
POD1000000014_S0000147 THEY CAN CONTACT US ON THE WEB
POD1000000014_S0000148 WE'RE EVEN ABLE TO COLLECT OUR POSTS THAT WERE DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM USING THE POST OF THE MOMENT BUT THE EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT WE CAN KEEP GOING
POD1000000014_S0000149 THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE ARE PROBABLY MORE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTIES BEING FACED BY THE SERVICES WE'RE DEALING WITH
POD1000000014_S0000150 SO WE'VE TOLD THE HEALTH SERVICE WE'VE TOLD NURSING HOMES SOME WE'VE TOLD THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION WHICH DEALS WITH BENEFITS AND PENSIONS
POD1000000014_S0000151 THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL TAKE THEM LONGER TO RESPOND TO US AND THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO
POD1000000014_S0000152 SO SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND BUT IN GENERAL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP GOING
POD1000000014_S0000153 JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH
POD1000000014_S0000154 WE HAD ONE GENTLEMAN STUCK IN POLAND WHO COULDN'T GET BACK TO IRELAND WHO'D BEEN DENIED BENEFIT IN IRELAND EVEN THOUGH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE IN IRELAND AND HE NORMALLY LIVED AND WORKED
POD1000000014_S0000155 AND WE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE SUCCESSFULLY SO THAT HE GOT HIS BENEFITS SO WE'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AS THEY ARISE
POD1000000014_S0000156 I THINK IN THE LONGER TERM THE BE TWO THINGS REALLY ONE OF THEM IS JUST PRACTICAL
POD1000000014_S0000157 WE NOW KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR MORE OF OUR PEOPLE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY FROM HOME AND I CAN'T SEE US GOING BACK TO THE SITUATION BEFORE WERE ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DID THAT
POD1000000014_S0000158 I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL WORK FROM HOME AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED DURING THE CRISIS
POD1000000014_S0000159 BUT THE SECOND ISSUE FOR ME HAS BEEN THE POLLING DEATH TOLL AMONG PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE MANY OF WHOM SHOULDN'T BE THERE
POD1000000014_S0000160 AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN WORKING ON THEIR BEHALF AFTER THE CRISIS TO MAKE SURE THAT SHOULD THERE BE A RESURGENCE OR SHOULD SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THIS COME ALONG
POD1000000014_S0000161 THE THIRD NOT AS EXPOSED IN AS VULNERABLE AS THEY ARE THE MOMENT
POD1000000014_S0000162 IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE FOR THE OMBUDSMAN TO BE LOOKING AT BOTH HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE MATTERS
POD1000000014_S0000163 NOT AS IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A SEPARATION WHERE ONE ON WOODSMAN LOOKED AT SOCIAL CARE AND THE OTHER LOOKS AT HEALTH
POD1000000014_S0000164 I'LL JUST IF I MAY RUB JUST ADD SOMETHING
POD1000000014_S0000165 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE UK ENGLAND IN PARTICULAR IS THAT THERE IS A SINGLE NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN IN
POD1000000014_S0000166 SO THAT ISSUES OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE COME BOTH COME INTO MY JURISDICTION
POD1000000014_S0000167 THE REALITY IS THAT THESE ARE COMPLEX INTERLINKED ISSUES
POD1000000014_S0000168 I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEM WITH TWO SEPARATE OMBUDSMAN THE OFFICES IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH AS IT IS
POD1000000014_S0000169 TRYING TO DO SO IN THE CONTEXT WHERE YOU HAVE NP FILTERS
POD1000000014_S0000170 WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS APPLYING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UK IT'S IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELF
POD1000000014_S0000171 BUT YOU MANAGED IT VERY WELL ALONG WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000014_S0000172 I HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE MANAGED IN PRACTICE TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPOSSIBLY COMPLEX SCENARIO FOR COMPLIANCE
POD1000000014_S0000173 IN IRELAND SOMEBODY WANTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES THEY COME TO MY OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000174 IN YOUR CASE IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
POD1000000014_S0000175 AND I DO HOPE THAT THE PROPOSALS FOR OMBUDSMAN REFORM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE UK OVER RECENT YEARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY LOST
POD1000000014_S0000176 AND THAT WE DO COME TO A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A PROPER NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR COMPLAINTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTICULAR PUBLIC SERVICE THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT
POD1000000014_S0000177 AND I DO HOPE THAT HAPPENS BEFORE I DIE WHICH I'M INCREASINGLY BECOMING DOUBTFUL ABOUT BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
POD1000000014_S0000178 PIZZA YOU CONDUCTED THE PEER REVIEW OF MY ORGANIZATION AND THEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN PARLIAMENT
POD1000000014_S0000179 SO THAT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT
POD1000000014_S0000180 WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING BEING THE PEER REVIEWER WHO HAD TO GO BEFORE THE UK PARLIAMENT
POD1000000014_S0000181 IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE ROBE
POD1000000014_S0000182 I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE CHALLENGING IF I HADN'T BEEN QUITE SO IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE YOUR OFFICE PROVIDES
POD1000000014_S0000183 IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE SERVICE WE USED A LOT OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
POD1000000014_S0000184 I KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH ONLY OFFICE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BUT IN GENERAL I WAS ABLE TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO THE COMMITTEE AS THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT COMPLAINANTS WE'RE RECEIVING
POD1000000014_S0000185 BUT ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN POWERS AND ENDURA STICTION THAT ARE CAUSING YOU DIFFICULTY IS IN
POD1000000014_S0000186 BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT I'D WANT TO SAY I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000187 AND IS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE THEY'RE VERY OPEN WITH
POD1000000014_S0000188 WE TALK TO YOUR STAFF WITHOUT TALKING TO YOURSELF FROM THE MANAGERS SO WE WERE ABLE FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS A VIEW AS THEY SAW FIT AND I THINK PEOPLE WERE VERY COMPLIMENTARY
POD1000000014_S0000189 SO I THINK AS I SAY IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
POD1000000014_S0000190 IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING TO GO BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND THE SESSION WAS QUITE SEARCHING
POD1000000014_S0000191 I THINK THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO REASSURE ITSELF THAT THIS WASN'T SOME KIND OF HAGIOGRAPHY
POD1000000014_S0000192 BUT WE WERE SATISFIED IN THE END THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SAY NO WE'VE LOOKED IN DETAIL AT THIS OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000193 THERE ARE AREAS WHICH CAN IMPROVE BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS AN IMPROVING SERVICE THAT'S DELIVERING GOOD QUALITY OMBUDSMAN SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND AND TO THE UK
POD1000000014_S0000194 WELL I THINK THE STRUCTURAL POINT IS THANKS TO THE IOI THIS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF PEER REVIEW LOOKS LIKE IT HAS LEGS FOR THE WIDER OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY
POD1000000014_S0000195 IT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY OF ADDING TO SCRUTINY OF OMBUDSMAN SCHEMES SO THANK YOU FOR THE ROLE THAT YOU PLAY IN PIONEERING THAT
POD1000000014_S0000196 ONE THING BEYOND THAT TO RUBBERS THAT
POD1000000014_S0000197 SINCE THE REVIEW WAS UNDERTAKEN THE IOWA ALONG WITH OTHER BODIES HAVE WORKED QUITE HARD
POD1000000014_S0000198 WITH THE VENICE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN DEVELOPING A SET OF OVERRIDING PRINCIPLES FOR OMBUDSMAN OFFICE HAS THE VENICE PRINCIPLES AS THEY'VE BECOME KNOWN
POD1000000014_S0000199 AND THAT NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE
POD1000000014_S0000200 AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A PROPER INTERNATIONAL STANDARD AGAINST WHICH OMBUDSMAN OFFICERS CAN BE JUDGED
POD1000000014_S0000201 AND SO I'M KEEN TO SEE THEM BEING USED AS THEY ARE BEING USED NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF PEER REVIEW
POD1000000014_S0000202 SO THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE SET OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDS AGAINST WHICH YOU'RE MEASURING A PARTICULAR OMBUDSMAN OFFICE
POD1000000014_S0000203 I THINK THAT'S AGAIN MARKS ANOTHER STEP FORWARD AND ONE THAT I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE SEEN DEVELOPED
POD1000000014_S0000204 I THINK WHEN I UNDERTOOK THE PEER REVIEW OF THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN WITH MY BELGIAN COUNTERPART
POD1000000014_S0000205 WE USED THOSE VERY SAME VALUES PRINCIPLES AS THE BENCHMARK AGAINST WHICH TO JUDGE THE CATALONIAN
POD1000000014_S0000206 IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S WITHOUT
POD1000000014_S0000207 IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE SO I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT
POD1000000014_S0000208 SO TWO FINAL QUESTIONS HOW HAVE YOU PETER TYNDALL REACTED TO WORKING REMOTELY BEING AT HOME WITH YOUR FAMILY
POD1000000014_S0000209 I'VE ENJOYED IT TO BE HONEST
POD1000000014_S0000210 IT HASN'T BEEN TOO FRUSTRATING THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE AN ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME BUT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO DIFFICULT
POD1000000014_S0000211 IT'S BEEN LESS DIFFICULT THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
POD1000000014_S0000212 DOES TIME GOES ON I THINK THE ISSUE OF VISIBLE LEADERSHIP COMES INTO IT DOESN'T
POD1000000014_S0000213 SO YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BE WITH YOUR PEOPLE AGAIN BUT BUT IT'S WORKS SURPRISINGLY WELL
POD1000000014_S0000214 AND
POD1000000014_S0000215 AS I SAY I THINK FOR THE OFFICE ITSELF I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE REMOTE WORKING IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000014_S0000216 THANK YOU SO LASTLY THEN IT'S WHAT I ALWAYS ASK MY GUESTS
POD1000000014_S0000217 WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUNG COLLEAGUES NEWLY ARRIVING AS CASEWORKERS IN THE EMBRYONIC OMBUDSMAN PROFESSION
POD1000000014_S0000218 FOR ME THERE'S A THERE'S A COUPLE OF CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE TO BE EMBODIED BY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SERVICE OR AS AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000014_S0000219 WE HAVE TO BE OBJECTIVE WE HAVE TO BE FAIR
POD1000000014_S0000220 WE HAVE TO BE EVEN HANDED SO THE FIRST ADVICE OFTEN IS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY BEFORE YOU REACH A CONCLUSION
POD1000000014_S0000221 BUT UNDERPINNING ALL OF THAT I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE THEN YOU'RE IN THE WRONG JOB
POD1000000014_S0000222 BECAUSE WHAT THIS FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT IS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY IS DENIED ACCESS TO JUSTICE

POD1000000017_S0000023 IT IS LIKE OUR SOFT RAUCOUS PERIOD IN AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000025 THE JOKE OF YACHT ROCK IS THAT WHOEVER INVENTED IT AND WHOEVER'S MAKING A PLAYLIST OUT OF THESE SONGS IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT THEY'RE INCONSEQUENTIAL AND THAT WHAT'S IN THEM DOESN'T
POD1000000017_S0000027 BUT WHAT I KNOW I'M HEARING IS SOMETHING BIGGER AND DEEPER THAN THAT
POD1000000017_S0000029 EVERY SONG HAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE OTHER SONG
POD1000000017_S0000031 I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANNA BY TOTO
POD1000000017_S0000033 WHICH SEEMS PERFECTLY BANAL HAS A REALLY GOOD BEAT SORT OF BUILDS TO ITS CORRESPONDING
POD1000000017_S0000035 BUT THEN AT THE END
POD1000000017_S0000037 I'M HEARING
POD1000000017_S0000039 THE GREAT DOO WOP HARMONIES OF THE 50S AND 60S
POD1000000017_S0000041 THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN
POD1000000017_S0000043 YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000045 THAT IS LIKE A GOSPEL BREAKDOWN
POD1000000017_S0000047 WHAT I'M HEARING IN ALL OF THESE SONGS IS BASICALLY BLACKNESS
POD1000000017_S0000049 AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY AT LEAST TO ME STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS THIS IS IT COMES
POD1000000017_S0000051 IT'S GOT A KIND OF LOOSELY DISCO LIKE RHYTHM TO IT THERE'S A LOT OF PERCUSSION SORT OF GOING BACK AND FORTH AND AROUND
POD1000000017_S0000053 SURE KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SINGING WHISPERING THE VERSES OF THIS SONG
POD1000000017_S0000055 DOING THIS VERY LIGHT
POD1000000017_S0000056 COOL
POD1000000017_S0000058 WHAT'S LEMON IN THE PRE CHORUS KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000060 GIVING KENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF
POD1000000017_S0000062 WHEN HE SINGS THE WORD MIRACLE HE DOESN'T SING MIRACLE HE GOES AMERICA
POD1000000017_S0000064 LIKE HE IS SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF A PAN TO GET ALL OF THE GOOD BITS OFF OF IT BEFORE YOU POUR THE GRAVY IN
POD1000000017_S0000066 SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER AND HERE IS KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING
POD1000000017_S0000068 NO AND THEN THE GRAVY COMES
POD1000000017_S0000070 HE IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF THE CHURCH AT THIS POINT
POD1000000017_S0000071 HE IS LIKE ELEVATED HIMSELF TO THE RAFTERS THERE'S LIKE NO MORE HE IS LIKE AT THE ROOF TRYING TO CLEAR A WAY TO GET TO HEAVEN BUT THERE'S JUST CHURCH ROOF IN THE WAY
POD1000000017_S0000073 HE'S NOT THE GREATEST SINGER BUT THERE'S A KIND OF GUMPTION AND NERVE TO THE SINGING OF THE SONG
POD1000000017_S0000075 BIG CANNOT BE DENIED A TIP OF THE HAT TO HIM
POD1000000017_S0000076 I JUST HAD TO STAND THERE AND I JUST I ACTUALLY CRACKED UP I HAD TO I JUST PUT DOWN THE KNIFE AND I CRACKED UP AND IT FELT SO PLEASURABLE AND THEN I SORT OF THING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER SINGERS I LOVE
POD1000000017_S0000078 I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000080 XENA BUT ANNIE LENNOX
POD1000000017_S0000082 LEAN ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL
POD1000000017_S0000084 I THINK ABOUT CHRIS STAPLETON
POD1000000017_S0000085 BALLROOM YOU PRACTICES A KIND OF MUSCLE E BLUES THAT GETS WRITTEN OFF HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE'S A BIG WHITE GUY AND A HAT
POD1000000017_S0000087 AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R&B AND SOUL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000089 THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNIE LENNOX AND AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000090 AND IT FILLS ME WITH PRIDE LIKE I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE AND ULTIMATELY INEVITABLE ABOUT BLACK MUSIC BEING A PART OF AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000091 BUT IT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT THERE'S A HISTORY TO THIS A VERY PAINFUL HISTORY AND IN THE MOST PERVERSELY IRONIC WAY IT'S THIS HISTORICAL PAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000093 SOME OF THE OLDEST RECORDINGS WE HAVE OF BLACK AMERICAN MUSIC ARE FROM THE 1930S
POD1000000017_S0000094 AND THEIR SONGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUNG BY AMERICANS BORN INTO SLAVERY THERE'S THIS ONE CALLED OLD SHIP OF ZION
POD1000000017_S0000095 YOU CAN HEAR IT AT THESE FOUR MEN THEIR VOICES ARE MOVING IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER
POD1000000017_S0000097 AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S ALL SO SAD YOU CAN FEEL THAT IN YOUR BONES
POD1000000017_S0000098 AND THEN THERE'D BE MUSIC THAT WAS COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE LIKE OLD COON DOG FOR
POD1000000017_S0000100 YOU CAN HEAR THE PLAYFULNESS IN THE SONG
POD1000000017_S0000102 AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BANJO THIS GREAT AFRICAN INSTRUMENT THAT BECOMES THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN MUSIC IN SO MANY WAYS AND THAT THING IS DANCING
POD1000000017_S0000103 AND THEN WHO WILL BE CHALLENGING CORNER YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCRAY CALL ME BRO
POD1000000017_S0000104 AND OH MY GOD YOU CAN HEAR IN HIS SINGING WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL SOMETHING LIKE THE LIVELONG DAY
POD1000000017_S0000106 YEARS AND YEARS OF HARD WORK
POD1000000017_S0000107 AN UNIMAGINABLE SORROW
POD1000000017_S0000109 YOU CAN ALSO HEAR IN ALL OF THIS MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000111 THIS UNDENIABLE SOUND OF HOPE
POD1000000017_S0000113 ALL OF THESE MELODIES AND CADENCES AND EMOTIONS ARE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED DOWN GENERATION AFTER GENERATION IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD IN A PLANTATION IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD WALKING BY A PLANTATION
POD1000000017_S0000114 IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOME TIME AROUND THE 1830S
POD1000000017_S0000115 AS THE STORY GOES TD RICE A WHITE MAN THIS ANONYMOUS NOBODY ACTOR TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
POD1000000017_S0000116 ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROOP IN CINCINNATI OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES TD RAISE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE
POD1000000017_S0000117 THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW
POD1000000017_S0000119 HE HEARD THE TUNE THIS OLD BLACK MAN WAS SINGING HE SAW THE WAY THIS MAN MOVED HIS BODY AS HE WAS CLEANING THIS HORSE
POD1000000017_S0000120 NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TUNE THIS ALL MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN SINGING
POD1000000017_S0000122 WHATEVER RACE HERE IS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000017_S0000124 BECAUSE SHOWBIZ IN THE 1830S LOOKED LIKE THIS
POD1000000017_S0000126 ITALIAN OPERAS
POD1000000017_S0000128 BRITISH PLAYS ENTERTAINMENT IMPORTED FROM EUROPE ALL THE PEOPLE PERFORMING THIS STUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE THE AUDIENCES WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE
POD1000000017_S0000129 AFTER ALL IT'S 1830 SLAVERY IS IN FULL EFFECT
POD1000000017_S0000131 AND WHEN IT CAME TO ENTERTAINMENT THERE WAS NOTHING NEW NOTHING TRULY
POD1000000017_S0000133 AND SO WHEN TT RACE HERE'S THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF
POD1000000017_S0000134 AND HE TAKES THAT LIGHTBULB AND RUNS ALL THE WAY TO THE THEATER HE FIGURES OUT A WAY TO MELT DOWN SOME CORK
POD1000000017_S0000135 LET'S IT COOL PRESUMABLY TAKES HER RAG OR MAYBE EVEN HIS HAND WITH HIS COOL ENOUGH
POD1000000017_S0000137 AND THEN HE PAINTS HIS FACE WOW
POD1000000017_S0000139 HE GOES OUT ON STAGE BUT INSTEAD OF DOING HIS REGULAR ACT HE'S GOT THIS HORSE GROOMERS TUNE EXCEPT NOW HE'S GIVEN THE TUNE LYRICS
POD1000000017_S0000140 COME LISTEN ALL YOU GIRLS AND BOYS I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE I'M WANNA SING A LITTLE SONG MY NAME'S JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000142 AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000144 SO THE CROWD GOES CRAZY THEY GO SO BANANAS THE MAN GETS 20 ENCORES
POD1000000017_S0000146 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM
POD1000000017_S0000147 AND THIS IS WHAT AMERICA REALLY WANTED WHICH WAS ITS OWN ORIGINAL ART FORM THAT IS NOT AN ITALIAN OPERA AND ISN'T SOME BRITISH GUY COMING OVER AND THAT'S BEING MEANING ALL OVER THEM
POD1000000017_S0000148 AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN
POD1000000017_S0000150 WELL BOY I MEAN YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES THIS SENSATIONAL THING HAPPENS AND THEN EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET ON THE BANDWAGON AND DO THEIR OWN
POD1000000017_S0000151 DO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE
POD1000000017_S0000152 AND A BLACK FACE ON THEIR WHITE SKIN
POD1000000017_S0000154 AND THEN FROM THESE SOLO ACTS YOU HAVE BASICALLY BANDS FOR
POD1000000017_S0000156 AND THE BANDS HAVE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN A BAND THAT YOU'D RECOGNIZE NOW THERE IS A BANJO AND A FIDDLE AND SOME TAMBOURINES AND PERCUSSION AND THE FORM OF BONES WHICH WOULD COME FROM A PIG SOMETIMES
POD1000000017_S0000157 THAT IS THE FORMATION OF WHAT WILL BECOME THE MINSTREL TROUPE
POD1000000017_S0000159 AND THE PLAYS THAT MINSTREL SEE TOOK HOLD WAS IN THE NORTH
POD1000000017_S0000160 PLACES LIKE PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK AND BOSTON WHERE YOU'D HAVE THESE THEATERS DEDICATED TO MINSTREL ACTS WHERE MENTAL ACTS WOULD JUST MOVE INTO A THEATER AND DO THEIR ACT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
POD1000000017_S0000161 AND A LOT OF THESE PERFORMERS HAVE NEVER BEEN MEANINGFULLY SOUTH TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND SO THEY JUST MADE STUFF UP BASED ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT BLACK PEOPLE WERE LIKE
POD1000000017_S0000163 THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW ON THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO AMERICA FROM OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE LIKE THE POLKA
POD1000000017_S0000165 AND SO YOU HAD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FORMATION OF THIS CULTURE AND INHERENT MAKES IT YOU HAD SOME AMAZING MIX OF AN IMAGINED BLACKNESS
POD1000000017_S0000166 REAL ACTUAL IRISH MELODIES AND POLISH MUSIC WITH WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL GOSPEL BUT SPIRITUAL HARMONIES INTERLACE TOGETHER WITH THIS AFRICAN
POD1000000017_S0000168 BASICALLY WELDING INTO A FUSION THAT BECOMES THE THING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO TRY TO DO
POD1000000017_S0000170 THE WHOLE THING JUST SWEEPS THE NATION AND FOR THE REST OF THE 19TH CENTURY THIS IS THE SHIT CAN WE SAY THAT
POD1000000017_S0000172 AND SO FOR THE REST OF THE 19TH CENTURY THIS IS THE SHIT
POD1000000017_S0000174 THIS IS AMERICA'S PRIMARY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY FOR BLACK BASEMENT ROLLS YOU HAVE LITTLE BOYS GOING TO BED AND DREAMING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BECOME PART OF THIS MINSTREL SHOW
POD1000000017_S0000175 SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER
POD1000000017_S0000177 STEPHEN FOSTER THE MAN WILDLY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN
POD1000000017_S0000179 SOME OF HIS SONGS SOME OF HIS MOST FAMOUS SONGS SONGS YOU KNOW SONGS YOU LOVE SONGS YOU STILL SING SONGS YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU HAVE THEM THEY STILL SING SOME OF THOSE SONGS WERE WRITTEN FOR BLACKFACE PERFORMERS
POD1000000017_S0000181 AND IF YOU LISTEN TO SOMETHING LIKE CAMPTOWN RACES YOU CAN HEAR IN IT ALL OF ITS MINSTREL
POD1000000017_S0000183 THE SONG OF COURSE IS WRITTEN IN SO CALLED NEGRO DIALECT I MEAN INSTEAD OF SAYING GO IN YOU'RE SAYING WINE
POD1000000017_S0000185 LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING OF4 OF YOU GET A LOT OF DE4 DO
POD1000000017_S0000187 THIS IS A WHITE PERSON IMAGINING HOW A BLACK PERSON WOULD SING THIS SONG
POD1000000017_S0000188 AND THAT WAS THE GOLD RUSH ERA HIT
POD1000000017_S0000190 THIS IS THE I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND OF 1851
POD1000000017_S0000192 PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE STILL LIVE WITH NOW IS THAT IT WAS SO MUCH THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICAN CULTURE THAT IT WASN'T THAT IT BECAME NOT RACIST
POD1000000017_S0000193 IT JUST WAS A THING THAT YOU DID IF YOU WANTED TO BE AN ENTERTAINER AT ANY POINT AFTER 1830 YOU AND ALL LIKELIHOOD WERE AT LEAST GONNA TRY TO BE A BLACKFACE MINSTREL EVEN IF YOU WERE BLACK
POD1000000017_S0000195 AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO PERFORM THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THE NATION WANTS AND WHAT THE NATION WANTS AT THAT POINT IS BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000196 AND NOW GIVING YOU NOISE IN TEMPLE
POD1000000017_S0000197 PEPPY MILLER AND SCATMAN CROTHERS
POD1000000017_S0000198 SO BLACK PEOPLE BLACKED UP AND PERFORMED AS BLACK PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T ACTUALLY BLACK
POD1000000017_S0000200 BY THE TIME YOU HAVE BLACK PEOPLE PAINTING THEIR FACES BLACK TO PERFORM AS BLACK PEOPLE THE ONLY QUESTION YOU CAN REALLY ASK AT THIS POINT IS WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
POD1000000017_S0000201 WHAT WAS SO CAPTIVATING ABOUT SEEING BLACK PEOPLE REPRESENTED THIS WAY WHY WOULD A WHITE AUDIENCE HAVE CLAMORED FOR IT SO MUCH I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT OFFERED WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT A THING THAT ACTUALLY FELT REALLY BAD AT THE TIME
POD1000000017_S0000202 PEOPLE WERE REALLY TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH SLAVERY OR WHETHER WILL POLISH IT THE MINSTREL SHOW DIDN'T REALLY GIVE YOU AN ANSWER
POD1000000017_S0000203 BUT IT PROVIDED A PLATFORM BY WHICH YOU COULD EITHER ESCAPE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION THAT REALLY WAS TEARING THE NATION APART OR DEPENDING ON WHICH SHOW YOU WILL WIND UP SEEING
POD1000000017_S0000204 IT FULLY ENGAGED YOU IN THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE WAY ABOUT ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND HOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY LIKE BEING ENSLAVED YOU GOT TO LAUGH AT A THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY FELT SO ANGUISHED ABOUT
POD1000000017_S0000205 YOU GET TO WATCH THESE BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY A SOURCE OF NATIONAL AGONY OUTSIDE THE THEATER BECOME FOOLS INSIDE THE THEATER AND IN SITTING IN THAT THEATER WATCHING THESE WHITE MEN IN BLACK FACE MAKE FOOLS OF BLACK PEOPLE
POD1000000017_S0000206 A WIDE AUDIENCE COULD FEEL CULTURE THEY COULD FEEL CIVILIZED THEY COULD FEEL SUPERIOR TO THE PEOPLE THEY WERE WATCHING BE MADE FUN OF
POD1000000017_S0000207 IN A CRAZY WAY WATCHING THEM TO HUMANIZE WHAT REALLY HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WHITE AUDIENCE TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT THEIR OWN HUMANITY
POD1000000017_S0000209 BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE 20TH CENTURY MINSTREL C IS STILL WITH US IT IS THE BASIS UPON WHICH AMERICAN MOVIES ARE BUILT THIS COUNTRY'S FIRST MOVIE BLOCKBUSTER
POD1000000017_S0000210 DW GRIFFITH'S THE BIRTH OF A NATION FULL OF WHITE MEN VILLAINOUSLY IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000212 AND AMERICA'S FIRST TALKING MOTION PICTURE
POD1000000017_S0000214 THE JAZZ SINGER ABOUT A JEWISH MAN WHO FEELS MOST HIMSELF NOT AS A JEWISH MAN STRUGGLING WITH HIS JEWISH IDENTITY AND PLEASING HIS CAN'T OR FATHER NO NO
POD1000000017_S0000216 IT'S WHEN HE BLACKS HIS FACE UP AND PERFORMS MIAMI AS A NEGRO
POD1000000017_S0000218 SOME OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE STARS DID NUMBERS IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000220 JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000222 BING CROSBY AND FRED ASTAIRE BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000224 WHITE CHRISTMAS HAS A WHOLE NUMBER MOST FAMOUS NUMBER IN WAY CHRISTMAS INVOLVES A BLACK BASE TUNE
POD1000000017_S0000226 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S THE BEGINNINGS OF A RECORDING INDUSTRY AND YOU HAD BLACK ARTISTS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO RECORDING STUDIOS
POD1000000017_S0000227 OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS
POD1000000017_S0000229 INVENTING AND PERFECTING BLUES RHYTHM BLUES IDEAS BLUES EXPRESSION THE EXPRESSION OF
POD1000000017_S0000231 OF A FULLY HUMAN BLACK SELF IN AMERICAN POPULAR ART
POD1000000017_S0000233 HE HAD A KIND OF CONFIDENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD COMING FROM A BLACK PERSON BEFORE
POD1000000017_S0000235 AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING
POD1000000017_S0000237 YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NO RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHET
POD1000000017_S0000239 LOUIS ARMSTRONG
POD1000000017_S0000241 AND DUKE ELLINGTON
POD1000000017_S0000243 YOU'VE BLACK MUSICIANS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MOVE NOT ONLY MUSIC FORWARD BUT AMERICAN CULTURE FORWARD
POD1000000017_S0000245 THINKING ABOUT HOW THESE INSTRUMENTS CAN DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES MAKE WHAT WE THINK OF AS WESTERN EUROPEAN CLASSICAL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000247 TAKING MUSIC TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAD EVER TRIED TO PREVIOUSLY TAKEN
POD1000000017_S0000249 PEOPLE WHO JUST KEPT PUSHING IT FORWARD AND BEYOND
POD1000000017_S0000251 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MOVEMENT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE EVER HAD ARTISTICALLY
POD1000000017_S0000253 AND THAT IS THE ADVENT OF MOTOWN RECORD
POD1000000017_S0000255 MOTOWN IS THE MOST POWERFUL MASS PRODUCED EXPRESSION OF BLACK GLAMOUR OF BLACK SELF CONFIDENCE OF BLACK SELF RELIANCE
POD1000000017_S0000257 IT'S PROJECT WAS TO GET BLACK PRODUCERS BLACK MUSICIANS BLACK SINGERS TO TAKE QUOTE WHITE QUOTE WESTERN MUSICAL IDEAS OF ORCHESTRATION STRINGS IN
POD1000000017_S0000259 THEN STRAIGHTFORWARD HARMONIES
POD1000000017_S0000261 AND YOU MARRY THEM TO A BLACK WEEKEND
POD1000000017_S0000263 WE'RE ON SATURDAY NIGHT YOU'RE AT A JUKE JOINT HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH RHYTHM AND BLUES MUSIC GUITAR AND DRUM BASS
POD1000000017_S0000265 SEX BASICALLY
POD1000000017_S0000267 AND THEN YOU GO HOME SLIGHTLY HUNGOVER
POD1000000017_S0000269 AND YOU WAKE UP AND YOU GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING
POD1000000017_S0000271 WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER MUSICAL EXPERIENCE INVOLVING HANDCLAPS AND DIFFERENT HARMONIC ARRANGEMENTS AND CALL AND RESPONSE
POD1000000017_S0000273 A LOT OF FEELING A LOT OF THEM A LOT OF GRATITUDE
POD1000000017_S0000275 YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE DIFFERENT AREAS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE MOTOWN
POD1000000017_S0000277 AND WHETHER IT'S THE FOUR TOPS DOING REACH OUT I'LL BE THERE
POD1000000017_S0000279 FOR MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS DOING HEATWAVE
POD1000000017_S0000281 ON SOMETHING LIKE HEAT WAVE YOU CAN HEAR HANDS SLAPPING THE TAMBOURINE LIKE IT ACTUALLY IS SUNDAY
POD1000000017_S0000283 THEN WHEN EVERYTHING IS FIRING
POD1000000017_S0000285 IT'S JUST THE MOST EXCITING ROMANTIC SOUND YOU'RE EVER GOING TO HEAR AND AT THE CENTER OF IT IS WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A REFULGENT TASTEFUL BLACKNESS
POD1000000017_S0000287 HERE YOU HAVE IN MOTOWN A FORCE THAT IS ACTIVELY COMBATING THESE IDEAS OF BLACK PEOPLE AS BEING INHERENTLY INFERIOR
POD1000000017_S0000289 MOTOWN IS THE ANTIDOTE TO AMERICAN MINSTRELSY
POD1000000017_S0000291 AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT STANDING THERE IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES IT'S THE THING THAT MADE ME LAUGH WAS JUST HOW ALL THAT HISTORY
POD1000000017_S0000292 IT'S JUST VERY SILENTLY COURSING THROUGH THIS MUSIC IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT IT'S EVEN THERE IT'S SO THOROUGHLY ATOMIZED INTO AMERICAN CULTURE IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP IN WAYS THAT EVEN PEOPLE MAKING THE ART CAN'T QUITE PUT THEIR FINGER ON
POD1000000017_S0000294 WILL YOUR HEARING IN BLACK MUSIC THAT'S SO APPEALING TO SO MANY PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACROSS TIME IS POSSIBILITY STRUGGLE IT IS STRIFE IT IS HUMOR
POD1000000017_S0000295 IT IS SEX IT IS CONFIDENCE AND THAT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THIS IS THE SOUND OF A PEOPLE WHO FOR DECADES AND CENTURIES HAVE BEEN DENIED FREEDOM
POD1000000017_S0000296 AND YET WHAT YOU RESPOND TO IN BLACK MUSIC IS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF A BELIEF IN THAT FREEDOM THE BELIEF THAT THE STRUGGLE IS WORTH IT IF THE PAIN BEGETS JOY
POD1000000017_S0000297 AND THAT THAT JOY YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS NOT ONLY CONTAGIOUS IT'S NECESSARY AND URGENT AND IRRESISTIBLE BLACK MUSIC IS AMERICAN MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000298 BECAUSE AS AMERICANS WE SAY WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND THAT'S WHAT WE TELL THE WORLD AND THE POWER OF BLACK MUSIC IS THAT IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THAT BELIEF IN AMERICAN FREEDOM
POD1000000018_S0000000 WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN 2012 CNN COVERED HIS DEATH OFF AND ON THE ENTIRE DAY
POD1000000018_S0000001 YOU'VE ALL SEEN THIS TYPE OF NEWS COVERAGE BEFORE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAREER IMAGES OF THE STAR ON THEIR PRIME PHONE AND CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO WERE CLOSE WITH THE DEPARTED
POD1000000018_S0000003 LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000018_S0000005 WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK
POD1000000018_S0000007 THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK
POD1000000018_S0000009 HOWEVER IN 2015 THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN
POD1000000018_S0000010 A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY FROM HOUSTON TEXAS WHO LOST ONLY 53 OF THE 1,500 CASES WHERE CLIENTS OF HIS FACE THE DEATH PENALTY WITH ONLY ONE OF THOSE LOSSES RESULTING IN AN ACTUAL
POD1000000018_S0000012 PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEMS PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT
POD1000000018_S0000014 SO INSTEAD OF ONE JUDGE WHO'S HEARD IT ALL BEFORE DETERMINING HIS CLIENTS FATE
POD1000000018_S0000016 PERCY HAD 12 AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL
POD1000000018_S0000017 THEY WERE UP TO NO GOOD THE COMMUNITY WAS FAR BETTER OFF WITHOUT THAT ELEMENT IN IT AND EVEN IF HIS CLIENT HAD KILLED HIM WELL HELL THEY NEEDED KILLING
POD1000000018_S0000019 FOREMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME
POD1000000018_S0000020 OFTEN NOTHING MORE THAN PROBATION NO TIME AT ALL IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SANCTIONED FORM OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE
POD1000000018_S0000021 PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE
POD1000000018_S0000023 NOW JIM DENNY WASN'T FROM TEXAS HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE
POD1000000018_S0000024 THE BUFFALO VALLEY AREA ABOUT 60 MILES EAST OF NASHVILLE WAS A REAL POOR AREA TO BE BORN IN 1911
POD1000000018_S0000025 WHEN A 16 YEAR OLD JIM DENNY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAIL ROOM OF WSM RADIOS PARENT COMPANY HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF
POD1000000018_S0000027 DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN 1927 THAT YEAR THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM WSM BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR
POD1000000018_S0000029 EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE SEE THE ARTIST AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000030 WITHIN 20 YEARS DANNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST SERVICE BUREAU AT WSM WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE ACTS ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000032 THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM DENNY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT
POD1000000018_S0000033 ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DANNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY
POD1000000018_S0000035 IT DIDN'T GO WELL DENNY IS RUMORED TO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE SON YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO DRIVING A TRUCK
POD1000000018_S0000037 THEN HE'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000039 CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALKED THE LINE IN THE TOP 10
POD1000000018_S0000041 JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN 1957
POD1000000018_S0000043 YOU'RE LISTENING TO COCAINE AND RHINESTONES THE PODCAST ABOUT 20TH CENTURY COUNTRY MUSIC AND THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO GAVE IT TO US
POD1000000018_S0000044 MY NAME IS TYLER MAY HENCO I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000045 AS FAR AS I CAN TELL HERE'S THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS ONE
POD1000000018_S0000047 IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TUBBS NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER
POD1000000018_S0000049 THERE ARE PLENTY OF STORIES ABOUT HIM BUT MOST OF THEM ARE ABOUT HOW GREAT OF A GUY HE WAS HE HAD AN ADORABLE NICKNAME ET AND YOU CAN HEAR ADMIRATION IN THE VOICE OF EVERYONE WHO CALLS HIM THAT
POD1000000018_S0000051 CRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW ERNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN 1914 INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS CHILDREN EARNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA
POD1000000018_S0000052 LONG DAYS IN THE FIELD ENTERTAINMENT FROM A STEREO IN THE EVENINGS AN EARLY BEDTIME AND YOU GET BACK UP THE NEXT DAY TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN TYPICAL DAY FOR A SHARECROPPER
POD1000000018_S0000054 LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WILL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A 14 YEAR OLD ERNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMY ROGERS
POD1000000018_S0000056 THE OBSESSION WAS INSTANT AND IT WOULD STEER THE COURSE OF THE REST OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000058 HEARING JIMMY ROGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUBB TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER
POD1000000018_S0000059 IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A 357 MAGNUM AT JIM DANDY
POD1000000018_S0000061 IN 1933 JIMMY ROGERS DIED YOUNG OF TUBERCULOSIS HE WAS 35
POD1000000018_S0000062 THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR ERNEST HOWEVER IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS
POD1000000018_S0000063 HE MOVED TO SAN ANTONIO MADE A FEW GUEST APPEARANCES ON A FRIEND'S RADIO SHOW AND MANAGED TO SECURE HIS OWN EARLY MORNING SHOW WHICH AIRED TWICE A WEEK NOT BAD FOR A 19 YEAR OLD KID
POD1000000018_S0000064 BUT DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE BIG TIME AND THE PAY WAS QUITE SLIM
POD1000000018_S0000066 HE HAD TO KEEP TO OTHER JOBS BESIDES THE RADIO GIG SOME DAYS HE WAS A DITCH DIGGER AND OTHER DAYS A DRUG STORE CLERK
POD1000000018_S0000067 HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE ELAINE THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER
POD1000000018_S0000069 EARNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMY ROGERS
POD1000000018_S0000070 HE'D HAVE THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMY FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMY ROGERS WIDOW CARE
POD1000000018_S0000071 HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMY THAT EARNEST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPH
POD1000000018_S0000072 CARRIE WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT EARNEST COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN KERRVILLE TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE
POD1000000018_S0000073 ERNEST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING TAKING A LANE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP
POD1000000018_S0000075 THEY PLAN TO STAY FOR MAYBE 10 MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER 2 HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS. ROGERS HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER
POD1000000018_S0000076 ET COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT HAVING HELD JIMMIE RODGERS SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMY'S NAME IN LATE IN PURL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK UPSIDE DOWN
POD1000000018_S0000077 SO HE CAN FLIP IT OVER TO SHOW AUDIENCES
POD1000000018_S0000079 CHOOSE YOUR BIGGEST DEAD HERO AND TRY TO THINK OF HOW YOU'D FEEL IF A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE HAPPENED TO YOU IT'S MIND BLOWING
POD1000000018_S0000080 OKAY NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER KARI ROGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO
POD1000000018_S0000081 ON ONE HAND SHE OFFERED TO HELP ET OUT WITH THE ACCESS SHE STILL HAD TO MUSIC BUSINESS BIG SHOT
POD1000000018_S0000082 ON THE OTHER HAND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMIE RODGERS WHEN HE SANG WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD ERNEST TUBB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000083 AND EVERYONE AROUND HIM HAD TOLD HIM THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'D BEEN DOING THE WHOLE TIME
POD1000000018_S0000085 ANYWAY SHE STILL HOOK TT UP WITH LC MCWILLIAMS THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMY ROGERS SONGS
POD1000000018_S0000086 ERNEST TUBB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000088 AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODEL FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN
POD1000000018_S0000089 JUMPING RIGHT BACK INTO HIS NORMAL ROUTINE WE INJURED HIS
POD1000000018_S0000091 IT CHANGED HIS VOICE FOREVER
POD1000000018_S0000093 ERNEST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING MUCH BETTER THAN HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000094 I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST HUBS NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF VOICE TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000096 YOU JUST HEARD SOME EARNEST HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098 NOW GEORGE JONES WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HANK WILLIAMS WAS HIS FAVORITE SINGER YOU DON'T GET HANK WITHOUT ERNEST AND ROY I'VE SEEN LEFTY FRIZZELL NAMED AS AN INFLUENCE ON GEORGE
POD1000000018_S0000099 LEFTY BORROWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000100 NOW THE PART OF ERNEST YOU CAN HERE IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NODE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000018_S0000101 NO MATTER IF IT'S A SONG YOU'VE HEARD PERFORMED BY OTHER PEOPLE
POD1000000018_S0000102 HERE'S GEORGE IN 1956 DOING HIS OWN COMPOSITION JUST ONE MORE
POD1000000018_S0000104 BOTH VERSIONS OF THE SONG ARE GREAT
POD1000000018_S0000106 IT'S POSSIBLE EARNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION HE HAD THAT TONSILLECTOMY IN 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107 IN 1940 HE HAD HIS BIGGEST HIT WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU THIS SONG IS STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH THE NAME ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000108 IF SOMEONE ONLY KNOWS ONE ERNEST TUBB SONG IT'S USUALLY THIS SONG
POD1000000018_S0000109 I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS BECOME A LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME
POD1000000018_S0000110 ET WAS FINALLY BIG TIME
POD1000000018_S0000111 THE TEXAS TROUBADOUR ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000114 HE JOINED THE GRAND OLE OPRY IN 1943 INFORMED THE FIRST INCARNATION OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS
POD1000000018_S0000115 THAT TEMPLATE STAY WORKING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS WOULD BE REPLACED EVERY NOW AND THEN
POD1000000018_S0000116 BUDDY EMMONS JACK GREENE BILLY BIRD LEON ROADS AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOINED THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER
POD1000000018_S0000118 THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY EARNEST BOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND CARRY ROGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM
POD1000000018_S0000119 YOUR DAD MADE ALL THOSE GUYS HOUSEHOLD
POD1000000018_S0000120 YES
POD1000000018_S0000121 JUSTIN TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000122 HE WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAD TO CALL NAMES OUT ON RECORD AND HE LOVED DOING THAT HE LOVES THE GUYS AND THEY WERE A BIG PART OF HIS SHOW I MEAN HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE CREDIT FOR
POD1000000018_S0000123 AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY TOOK A COURSE BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREENE AND CAL SMITH
POD1000000018_S0000124 AND YOURS HE HAD TO WILL BRIDGE WITH HIM FOR A WHILE AND SKEETER WORK SOME DATES WITH HIM GEORGE JONES STONEWALL JACKSON AND HE WAS ALWAYS PUSHING THEM AND HE LIKE ROY I THINK UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BIGGER THEY BECAME THE BIGGER HE BECAME
POD1000000018_S0000125 GEORGE JONES AND STONEWALL JACKSON WERE NEVER TEXAS TROUBADOURS JUSTIN MEANT ET TOOK THOSE GUYS OUT ON TOUR WITH HIM AS OPENING ACTS TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR OWN FOLLOWING AND OFTEN HE DID A LOT MORE THAN THAT

POD1000000018_S0000131 AND EVIDENTLY BUDDY HAD TOLD HIM
POD1000000018_S0000132 THE CALLER SAID WE GOT ON HE SAID I TALKED TO HIM A WHILE I WAS YOU KNOW AND HE SAID WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME TO LEAVE HE SAID YEAH

POD1000000018_S0000134 HE TOOK ME ON THE ROAD WELL THAT GIVE ME A SUIT I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR SO HE GAVE ME ONE OF HIS OLD SUITS AND TOOK HIM TO THE CLEANERS AND HAD IT CUT DOWN THE FIRST DATE WE GOT IN TEXAS
POD1000000018_S0000135 AND IT WAS SO THERE'S TWO POCKETS IN THE BACK THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU HAD TO TAKE BUT I IT WAS A AND I STILL GOT A PICTURE OF ME AND IN THAT SUIT
POD1000000018_S0000136 AND I HE LET ME GO OUT AND I OPENED HIS SHOW FOR HIM FOR 10 DAYS AND HE FED ME AND AT THE END OF HIS TOUR GAVE ME SOME MONEY SO THAT'S KIND OF GUY HE WAS
POD1000000018_S0000138 YOU CAN'T TELL THE HANK SNOW STORY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT ERNEST TUBB ET HE TOLD JOHNNY CASH NOT TO SMILE WHEN HE PERFORMED FOLSOM PRISON BLUES SO PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD REALLY FEEL THE SONG
POD1000000018_S0000139 CASH NEVER FORGOT THE ADVICE HANK WILLIAMS SENIOR WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ERNEST MUSIC AND ERNEST IS THE ONE WHO CONVINCED THE GRAND OLE OPRY TO BRING HANK BACK AFTER HIS FIRST FAILED AUDITION
POD1000000018_S0000140 ET GOT HANK TO PROMISED HE WOULDN'T TOUCH ANY BOOZE FOR THREE MONTHS TO SWING THAT ONE
POD1000000018_S0000141 IN 1947 ENOUGH RADIO LISTENERS WHAT LETTERS COMPLAINING OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND HIS MUSIC THAT HE LAUNCHED THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP IN NASHVILLE IF YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE IN PERSON THEY'D SHIP RECORDS DIRECTLY TO YOU
POD1000000018_S0000142 IT WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS AND WOULD HELP KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE WHEN ROCK AND ROLL STEAMROLLED AMERICA IN THE 50S
POD1000000018_S0000144 THE RECORD SHOP OPERATED AT A LAWS OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT WAS OPEN BUT ERNEST KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HE KEPT IT ALIVE
POD1000000018_S0000145 THE OPRY WAS A GREAT PROMOTIONAL TOOL FOR HIM AND HE'D STARTED HIS OWN SHOW ON WSM IN THE FOLLOWING TIME SLOT WHEN THE OPRY WAS OVER FANS COULD STAY TUNED IN FOR THE MIDNITE JAMBOREE
POD1000000018_S0000147 ERNEST PLAYED HOST TO OPRY STARS AND NEWCOMERS ALIKE MAKING SURE TO REMIND YOU THIS MUSIC WAS AVAILABLE FOR MAIL ORDER FROM ERNEST TUBBS RECORD SHOP HE TOOK THE CHANCE TO KEEP JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORY ALIVE PITCHING HIS RECORDS AS WELL
POD1000000018_S0000149 ERNEST NEVER GREW OUT OF HIS FASCINATION WITH JIMMIE RODGERS AND NEVER STOPPED FOR PAYING HIS DEBT TO JIMMY'S WIDOW CARRY JIMMY'S DEATH HAD LEFT CARRY IN A PRETTY BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION BUT SHE STILL GOT MONEY FROM THE SALES OF HIS RECORDS WHICH WERE DECLINING
POD1000000018_S0000150 HE REALIZED THE MORE JIMMIE RODGERS RECORD SOLD THE BETTER OFF CAREY WOULD BE SO ETA PUSHED THOSE RECORDS AS HARD AS HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000151 CARRIE LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMY'S WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THIS IS JIMMIE RODGERS ON IT
POD1000000018_S0000152 IN 1953 ERNEST HELPED FOUND THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL IN ROGERS HOME TOWN OF MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI THAT'S A STAND UP GUY
POD1000000018_S0000154 YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000155 REMEMBER JIM POOR KID FROM TENNESSEE WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM THE MAILROOM TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT WSM AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000156 DIRECTOR OF ARTIST SERVICES WAS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING HE BOOKED THE MUSICAL ACTS THAT PLAYED ON THE RADIO STATION AS WELL AS THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000157 DANNY WAS A POWERFUL MAN IN NASHVILLE AND HE ACTED LIKE HE KNEW IT
POD1000000018_S0000158 WE'RE ERNEST TUBB BUILT A REPUTATION FOR HELPING YOUNG MUSICIANS JIM DENNY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ACTING LIKE A DICK
POD1000000018_S0000160 THE JOHNNY CASH ET GAVE ADVICE TO IS THE SAME JOHNNY CASH WHO HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE DENNY'S OFFICE
POD1000000018_S0000162 JIM DANNY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESSMAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD
POD1000000018_S0000163 THEN HE'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ON TO THE OPRY AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DANNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000164 HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES
POD1000000018_S0000165 HANK HAD MISSED A SCHEDULED OPRY APPEARANCE MOST LIKELY FOR NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN THAT HE WAS DRUNK DANNY SAID HE THOUGHT FIRING HANK WOULD MAKE HIM REALIZE HE NEEDED TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000166 THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DANNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION
POD1000000018_S0000167 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THE YEAR HANK WILLIAMS DIED IS THE SAME YEAR THAT JIM DENNY FORM CEDARWOOD PUBLISHING WITH WEBB PIERCE
POD1000000018_S0000169 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A PUBLISHING COMPANY IS IT USED TO BE THE HEART OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY ON THE SURFACE OF PUBLISHING COMPANIES PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE SURE SALES ROYALTIES WERE GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE
POD1000000018_S0000170 THEY TOOK A BIG PERCENTAGE TO DO THIS SO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE A HIT OUT OF ONE OF THEIR WRITERS SONGS THEY DO IT AND IF THEY FORGOT TO SEND YOU YOUR WHOLE ROYALTY CHECK SOMETIMES WELL SHIT HAPPENS
POD1000000018_S0000172 ROY ACUFF AND FRED ROSE HAD STARTED A CUFF ROSE MUSIC BACK IN 1942
POD1000000018_S0000173 SO MANY COUNTRY RIDERS WERE BEING SCREWED OVER BY PUBLISHING COMPANIES BASED OUT OF OTHER CITIES THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE ONE IN NASHVILLE AN HONEST PUBLISHING COMPANY RUN BY COUNTRY ARTISTS FOR COUNTRY ARTISTS
POD1000000018_S0000174 THEY WERE THE BEST GAME IN TOWN UNTIL JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD IN 53
POD1000000018_S0000175 AS HEAD OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT WSM AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY JIM DENNY CONTROLLED WHO GOT THE PLAY ON THE OPRY THEIR PLACE IN THE LINEUP AND HOW LONG THEY GOT TO PLAY
POD1000000018_S0000176 CAN YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS HEADING
POD1000000018_S0000178 IF JIM DANNY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA THAN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY
POD1000000018_S0000180 ONCE HE'S GOT A WRITER SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD THEN HE'S GETTING A HUGE PIECE OF ANY MONEY THEIR SONGS MAKE IF THAT WRITER ALSO WANTS TO BE A PERFORMER CONGRATULATIONS YOU'RE ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000181 IF THE WRITER DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PERFORMER CONGRATULATIONS WEBB PIERCE IS THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE OPRY AND HE'S PLAYING YOUR SONG ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000182 ROY ACUFF WAS PISSED OFF AND HE DIDN'T STAY QUIET ABOUT IT HE SAID DENNY WAS GIVING THE BEST SPOTS TO HIS OWN ARTIST ARTIST SIGNED TO A ACUFF ROSE HAD A TENDENCY TO SEE ROY'S
POD1000000018_S0000183 ARTIST SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD HAD A TENDENCY TO THINK JIM DENNY WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG WEIRD HUH
POD1000000018_S0000184 LONG STORY SHORT IN 1956 WSM FIRED JIM DANNY OVER HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
POD1000000018_S0000186 HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTIST SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DANNY WAS FIRED THEN DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000187 THEIR COMPETITION IN THE CIGARETTE BUSINESS R.J. REYNOLDS WAS A SPONSOR OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000188 SO WHEN JIM DENNY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN
POD1000000018_S0000189 HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINE UP THESE FANS LISTEN TO EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT WAS COMING TO STAGES ACROSS AMERICA FOR LIVE APPEARANCES
POD1000000018_S0000190 WITH PHILIP MORRIS PAYING FOR EVERYTHING THE ADMISSION WAS EVEN FREE
POD1000000018_S0000191 IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOK TO STOP IN MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE FIFTH ANNUAL JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL
POD1000000018_S0000192 BUT IT WAS WORSE THE PHILIP MORRIS SHOW WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE SECOND NIGHT OF THE TWO DAY JIMMIE RODGERS FESTIVAL
POD1000000018_S0000194 FOR FIVE YEARS ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMIE RODGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO ET PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOL
POD1000000018_S0000196 JIM DENNY WASN'T SIMPLY SETTING UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET WITH SOME HEALTHY COMPETITION
POD1000000018_S0000197 HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMIE RODGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000198 IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE THAT AS A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF COACHELLA SET UP A FESTIVAL EIGHT MILES AWAY FROM BONNAROO ON THE SAME WEEKEND FOR FREE
POD1000000018_S0000199 IT WOULD CRUSH BONNAROO THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR
POD1000000018_S0000200 THEY REGROUPED TO PUT ONE ON AGAIN IN 1959 BUT CARRY ROGERS HEALTH HAD ALREADY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE AND ERNEST TUBB WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE FESTIVAL AGAIN
POD1000000018_S0000202 MOSTLY A KIND MAN ET WAS DIFFERENT WHEN HE'D BEEN DRINKING A BEER OR TWO WHILE GAMBLING WITH THE GUYS HE'D BE FINE BUT IT WAS THE TIMES WHEN HE'D GET TO DRINKING FOR A WHOLE DAY OR TWO OR FIVE
POD1000000018_S0000203 YOU HAD MIRRORS WOULD GET SMASHED WINDOWS BROKEN HE HAD A THING ABOUT GLASS
POD1000000018_S0000205 ACCORDING TO BILLY BYRD ERNEST HUBS REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK
POD1000000018_S0000206 THEY CARTED HIM BACK TO NASHVILLE BUT HE WAS STILL DRINKING AND HE WAS STILL MAD AS HELL AT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000207 FINALLY HE CALLED DANNY AT HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO CUSS HIM OUT DENNY SAID SOMETHING LIKE WELL IF YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT IT THEN HOW ABOUT YOU JUST MEET ME DOWN AT WSM RIGHT NOW AND WILL SETTLE THINGS FOR GOOD
POD1000000018_S0000209 THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT PLAN TO ERNEST TUBB HE STRAPPED ON A GUN BELT WITH BULLETS AND A 357 MAGNUM IN THE HOLSTER AND DROVE DOWNTOWN IN HIS CADILLAC WEARING HOUSE SLIPPERS
POD1000000018_S0000210 MEANWHILE WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO EARNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP
POD1000000018_S0000212 SO ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE WSM WAS LOCATED
POD1000000018_S0000213 IT'S CLOSE TO 5:30 IN THE MORNING PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SHOW UP FOR WORK
POD1000000018_S0000215 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT THE GUN GETS FIRED IN ALL OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000217 BILL WILLIAMS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT WSM SAYS HE WAS WALKING INTO WORK WHEN A GUNSHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL
POD1000000018_S0000218 HE TURNED AROUND YOU KNOW PRETTY SCARED AND SAW ERNEST TUBB STANDING THERE IN HIS HOUSE SLIPPERS WITH A REVOLVER
POD1000000018_S0000220 WHEN HE ASKED ERNEST WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING EARNEST SAID MY GOD I'VE SHOT THE WRONG MAN
POD1000000018_S0000221 WHETHER OR NOT HE'D BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL ANYONE WE WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY SHOT SOMEONE AND WAS ONLY UPSET THAT SOMEONE WASN'T JIM DANNY
POD1000000018_S0000222 EITHER WAY ERNEST SETTLE DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK THE WIT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE EARNEST HOME
POD1000000018_S0000223 HE WOULD HAVE EXCEPT THE POLICE HAD BEEN CALLED AS SOON AS OTHER EMPLOYEES HEARD A GUNSHOT IN THE OFFICE
POD1000000018_S0000225 ERNEST TUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNK AND DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON
POD1000000018_S0000226 IT WAS MANDATORY TO HOLD PUBLIC INTOXICATION ARRESTEES FOR THREE HOURS
POD1000000018_S0000227 SO EARNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME
POD1000000018_S0000229 SIXTY DOLLARS BOND GOT HIM OUT AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT
POD1000000018_S0000231 JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT
POD1000000018_S0000233 THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST HUBS CAREER WHATSOEVER APPARENTLY IF ALL ET WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY THEN THAT WAS FINE
POD1000000018_S0000235 HIS CAREER LASTED INTO THE 1980S HE WAS STILL DOING OVER 200 DAYS ON THE ROAD A YEAR AND HE ONLY QUIT IN 1982 BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS FROM HIS EMPHYSEMA
POD1000000018_S0000236 IN 1984 HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO JIMMY ROGERS
POD1000000018_S0000238 THE MIDNITE JAMBOREE STILL AIRS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AND YOU CAN STILL BUY MUSIC FROM ERNEST PUBS RECORD SHOP OR ONLINE AT ET RECORD SHOP.COM
POD1000000018_S0000240 WE'RE TOLD THAT IN 1963 ERNEST TUBB MADE UP WITH JIM DANNY BEFORE JIM PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER THE GYM DENNY ARTISTS BUREAU STAYED IN BUSINESS FOR ONLY A FEW MORE YEARS
POD1000000018_S0000242 JIM DENNY WAS INDUCTED TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME IN 1966 CEDARWOOD JIM DENNY'S PUBLISHING COMPANY WAS SOLD TO MEL TILLIS IN 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243 ERNEST TUBB HAD BEEN INDUCTED TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME IN 1965 WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE

POD1000000018_S0000251 IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SEND IN QUESTIONS THEN I'LL MAKE A Q&A EPISODE TO CLOSE OUT THE FIRST SEASON ALRIGHT LINER NOTES
POD1000000018_S0000252 OKAY FIRST OF ALL IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE EARNEST TUBS IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000018_S0000253 ASIDE FROM INFLUENCING BASICALLY EVERYONE WHO MATTERS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IF NOT IN FACT THE FIRST ARTIST TO BRING AN ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYER WITH HIM ONTO THE GRAND OLE OPRY STAGE
POD1000000018_S0000254 IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT HONKY TONK AND IT HAPPENED AFTER ERNEST TUBB IT WAS INFLUENCED BY ERNEST TUBB BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY IN THE EPISODE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING
POD1000000018_S0000255 IN THE 1980'S CLYDE MOODY TRIED TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION
POD1000000018_S0000256 THE CMP A HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN
POD1000000018_S0000257 AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD HE'D DONE SO MUCH TO HELP
POD1000000018_S0000258 THIS RUMOR IS STILL SPREAD AS FACT AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S TRUE
POD1000000018_S0000259 CHARLIE LOUVIN EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
POD1000000018_S0000260 FIRST OF ALL THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST HUBS ESTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING 70% OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN
POD1000000018_S0000261 IT'S JUST THAT'S NOT REALISTIC
POD1000000018_S0000262 I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY OF EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM
POD1000000018_S0000263 I DON'T REMEMBER WHO IT WAS BUT SOMEONE ACTUALLY DID GET IN TO SEE HIM AND THEY POINT BLANK SAID THEY WISH THEY HAD NOT GONE TO SEE HIM
POD1000000018_S0000264 THEY COULD TELL HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT AND THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT AND THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING THAT BE THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM SO HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID THAT
POD1000000018_S0000265 AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO WOULD TRY TO SEE ERNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000266 SO YOU KNOW I MEAN THE END I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED YOU KNOW AND I'M SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I THINK THAT HE DID
POD1000000018_S0000268 I THINK HE DID A LOT FOR A COUNTRY MUSIC AND I THINK HE WENT OUT THE WAY THAT HE WANTED TO GO IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME OKAY BACK TO ERNEST TUBB AND JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000269 WHAT ABOUT THIS STORY RIGHT IS WAS THAT CRAZY IT'S JUST SO MANY THINGS LIKE THE ROOTS OF COUNTRY MUSIC ARE JUST GROWING ALL OVER THIS STORY YOU KNOW YOU GOT JIM DENNY'S SHOWING UP RIGHT AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY IS BECOMING A THING

POD1000000022_S0000010 I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CHAOTIC WORLD AS A BABY JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT NO ONE'S REALLY BLAMING YOU FOR JUST SORT OF GOING ALONG WITH A LOT OF THE WAYS PEOPLE WERE DOING THINGS AROUND YOU
POD1000000022_S0000011 THERE'S A LOT TO FIGURE OUT AND A LOT OF THESE WAYS WE'VE LEARNED TO MAKE SENSE OF STUFF ARE TOTALLY ARBITRARY A LOT OF THE WAYS WE THINK ABOUT STUFF HAVE JUST BEEN SORT OF ALMOST BY ACCIDENT PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION PHILOSOPHERS REALIZE THIS
POD1000000022_S0000012 AND AT THE TIME OF SARTRE FOR OVER 300 YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING
POD1000000022_S0000013 THAT'S HOW ENTRENCHED RELIGION WAS IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE BACK THEN AND THAT EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO CHURCH EVEN IF YOUR FAMILY'S 15 GENERATIONS REMOVED FROM EVER HAVING STEP FOOT IN A CHURCH SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE SO FOUNDATIONAL THAT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF CONFUSED BABY TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT
POD1000000022_S0000014 I JUST WENT ALONG WITH CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXISTENCE THAT HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN CHRISTIANITY FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN LIFE RIGHT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'LL SAY

POD1000000022_S0000021 AND THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS MOMENT WHEN I LOOK AT THEM AND I REALIZE THEY'RE THE PERSON I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH PEOPLE DO THIS WITH ANYTHING THEY'LL DO IT WITH MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ONE DAY I'M GOING TO WATCH THE RIGHT PERSON SCREAMING AT ME TO BE A BETTER PERSON
POD1000000022_S0000022 AND FROM THEN ON OUT IT'S GOING TO BE EASY FOR ME TO GO TO THE GYM AND EAT PINE CONES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT LIFE CHOICES THAT SOME THINKERS BELIEVE IS A LONG LOST RELIC OF THE REVELATORY WAY WE USED TO THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE
POD1000000022_S0000023 THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP AND THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EVENT SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS
POD1000000022_S0000024 IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE JUST YOU KNOW FORWARD THEM TO THE POPE'S INBOX THAT'S A REASONABLE THING TO EXPECT IN THAT WORLD VIEW BUT THIS ISN'T THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF THESE LONG LOST REMNANTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN OUR THINKING
POD1000000022_S0000025 ANOTHER MAJOR ONE ANOTHER ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD STILL USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS IS THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND WHO THEY ARE JUST LIKE IN CHRISTIANITY WHERE YES YOU HAVE A BODY BUT YOUR TRUE SELF IS A SOUL
POD1000000022_S0000026 IT'S AN ETERNAL SPIRIT HIDDEN DEEP DOWN WITHIN THAT BODY THAT YOU HAVE AN INTERNET ACCESS TO JUST LIKE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD THINK OF THEIR TRUE SELF OR THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU AS A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN US THAT ONLY WE AND OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS HAVE ACCESS
POD1000000022_S0000027 YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE SURE WHEN I'M OUT IN PUBLIC I DO KIND OF PUT ON A MASK TO OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIAL UTILITY I MEAN I DON'T ACT LIKE MY 100% TRUE SELF IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THROUGH
POD1000000022_S0000028 YEAH I TELL PEOPLE THINGS THEY WANT TO HEAR I PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE LOOK THE FACT IS IT'S JUST NOT USEFUL TO
POD1000000022_S0000029 NOT TO MENTION I DON'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MY TRUE SELF TO THE PERSON IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THROUGH WHO AM I REALLY THOUGH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING I RESERVED FOR MY FAMILY AND MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN FACT EVEN SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DEPTHS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE ME
POD1000000022_S0000030 MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU BUT SOCCER WOULD SAY IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS
POD1000000022_S0000031 IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SOCCER WOULD SAY IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000032 AND YOU HAVE THIS IDEA UP IN YOUR HEAD OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S ONLY ACCESSED BY YOU AND YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS BUT DON'T IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DECEPTION GOING ON THERE MAYBE YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF A STORY YOU WANT TO HEAR THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TELLING THE STARBUCKS BARISTA STORY
POD1000000022_S0000033 THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES AND OCS KEYS BUT CRIME AND PUNISHMENTS THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES AND WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS
POD1000000022_S0000034 BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECOND ON THE FIRST ONE IS A LITTLE CARTOONISH BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE TO PULL US OUT OF THIS CONDITIONED WAY WE OFTEN LOOK AT THE SELF AND IT GETS US TO HONESTLY START ASKING THIS QUESTION WHERE IS THIS SELF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY LOCATED
POD1000000022_S0000035 FIRST EXAMPLE IMAGINE A GUY THAT THINKS HE'S THE POLIAN NOW HE SPENDS ALL DAY EVERYDAY DRESS IT UP AND PARISIAN MILITARY GARB HE BUILDS A BUNKER AT A COUCH CUSHIONS IN HIS FRONT ROOM AGONIZING TO HIMSELF HOW AM I GOING TO CONQUER MOSCOW
POD1000000022_S0000036 THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SAT HIM DOWN AND HE ASKED HIM CANDIDLY KNOW BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE COMMANDER THE ARMIES OF THE NIGHT
POD1000000022_S0000037 HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY AS OUTSIDERS WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS
POD1000000022_S0000038 INTERESTING HERE'S THE LESS CARTOONISH EXAMPLE AND TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS APPLIES TO YOU IMAGINE A GUY SITTING ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV WITH HIS PALS THEY TURN ON THE NEWS AND THERE'S A STORY ABOUT SOME MASS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED AT A WALMART
POD1000000022_S0000039 HERE'S THE STORY GETS KIND OF ANGRY TURNS TO HIS FRIENDS AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT GUY AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM THEY BETTER HOPE THEY NEVER SHOW UP AT MY WALMART SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN WHEN I'M THERE I'M NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE NEWS CHOPPER CAMERA SCREAMING AND RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE
POD1000000022_S0000040 I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION I MEAN I'M GONNA GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDES NECK I'M GONNA DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM THAT'S ME I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS
POD1000000022_S0000041 HE MAY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHO HE IS DEEP DOWN BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT BUT IF NEXT SATURDAY IS OUT SHOPPING WITH HIS FAMILY SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN AND ALL HIS WIFE AND KIDS SEE IS A POOF OF SMOKE AND THEN HE'S RUNNING OUT THE BACK DOOR WHO IS THAT GUY REALLY
POD1000000022_S0000042 IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE REFERENCE THIS THING WE CALL OURSELF INTUITIVELY IT CAN FEEL LIKE WELL I AM MYSELF I KNOW WHO I AM SO NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHO I AM BUT ME
POD1000000022_S0000043 IN FACT IF YOU JUST RECITED THAT STATEMENT IN MOST PUBLIC SETTINGS PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE YEAH YEAH YOU TELL THEM ONLY YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEEP DOWN INSIDE BUT IS THAT A DELUSION IS THAT JUST A NARRATIVE THAT WE TELL OURSELVES TO SIMPLIFY THIS CONCEPT OF THE
POD1000000022_S0000044 SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH MANY MORE MOVING PARTS
POD1000000022_S0000045 AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND START REVIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT THE STARTER SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS ARE FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000046 AND OUR TRANSCENDENCE IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING THAT'S ALIVE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE BOTH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE PUT VERY SIMPLY OUR FACTICITY IS THE COLLECTION OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000047 AND TRANSCENDENCE IS OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL LET'S BREAK IT DOWN FURTHER THOUGH REMEMBER LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT BEING IN ITSELF VERSUS BEING FOR ITSELF BEING IN ITSELF AS BEING KIND OF LIKE MATTER THIS INERT FEATURELESS BLOB OF
POD1000000022_S0000048 FOLEY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION BUT ONE DAY WHEN SARGE WAS TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF
POD1000000022_S0000049 BOAT IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTEN TO LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN START TO POINT OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000050 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF IS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS AT START TO COOKED UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000022_S0000051 SEARCH FOR NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US
POD1000000022_S0000052 YOU ASK ME WHO I AM AND OFTENTIMES I WILL STATE THE FACTS ABOUT MYSELF OH I AM 117 YEARS OLD THAT'S A FACT I AM A HORSE WRANGLER BY PROFESSION THAT'S A FACT I MAKE $28,000 A YEAR I DRIVE A FORD FOCUS
POD1000000022_S0000053 I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT STARTER WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM
POD1000000022_S0000054 THEY NEVER TELL US THE FULL STORY AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND A HUMAN BEING JUST BY DEFAULT IS TO UNDERSTAND A TYPE OF BEING THAT HAS POSSIBILITIES NONE OF US ARE PURE FACTICITY IN OTHER WORDS
POD1000000022_S0000055 THE ONLY TIME A HUMAN BEING IS PURE FACTICITY IS WHEN THEY'RE DEAD YES WE HAVE A SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE INTO SOMETHING ELSE AND IF WE'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE SELF IF WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE OF WHO SOMEONE IS
POD1000000022_S0000056 THE CHOICES WE MAKE ABOUT WHICH OF THESE POSSIBILITIES WE'RE GOING TO BRING ABOUT END UP BEING JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M GOING TO SCHOOL TO BECOME AN IT CONSULTANT OR IF I'M TRAINING FOR A MARATHON OR IF I'M LOSING A BUNCH OF WEIGHT FOR WEDDING PICTURES
POD1000000022_S0000057 A BIG PART OF UNDERSTANDING WHO I AM IS UNDERSTANDING THE THING I'M ACTIVELY TRYING TO CHANGE INTO AND IT CONSULTANT MARATHON RUNNER IN OTHER WORDS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THE FULL PICTURE OF ME IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT I AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000058 YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD START YOUR DESCRIPTION CREEPIN IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000059 WHEN I CONSIDER MY TRANSCENDENCE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IN BEING FOR ITSELF THESE TWO ASPECTS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE ARE ENTANGLED INTERTWINED AND IN SOME CASES RELIANT ON EACH OTHER FOR THE VERY EXISTENCE
POD1000000022_S0000060 YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE ARE CONSTANTLY AFFECTING EACH OTHER AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE ARE OFTEN TIMES CAUSED BY WHAT POSSIBILITIES YOU DECIDE TO BRING ABOUT AND THE POSSIBILITIES YOU'VE DECIDED TO EXPLORE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LIMITED BY THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE
POD1000000022_S0000061 LET'S STOP AT THE HYPOTHETICALS AND JUST GIVE A REAL EXAMPLE RIGHT ME I'LL USE ME AS AN EXAMPLE I AM 6 FEET TALL A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO POUNDS THIS MORNING NOW NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO
POD1000000022_S0000062 I AM NEVER GOING TO BECOME A HORSE JOCKEY THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOR ME AS LONG AS THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE 4 FOOT 8 85 POUNDS THE FACTICITY THAT I'M A CERTAIN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS MY ABILITY TO TRANSCEND AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS
POD1000000022_S0000063 I NEVER WIN THE KENTUCKY DERBY IT'S NOT HAPPENING THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR ABILITY TO TRANSCEND IS OFTENTIMES LIMITED BY THE FACTS ABOUT US ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS BORN WITH A PARTICULAR FACE AND A PARTICULAR ABILITY TO PUT ON MUSCLE
POD1000000022_S0000064 NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO I AM NEVER GOING TO BE AN INSTAGRAM MODEL THE FACTICITY OF MY FACE MY FACE MY FACE TISSA T AND I ALL THE OTHER STUFF GOING ON THERE
POD1000000022_S0000065 LOOK I WILL NEVER BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT PEOPLE WANT TO VOLUNTARILY LOOK AT AND THEN CLICK AN EMOJI THAT SIGNIFIES HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT THE MOST RECENT PICTURE OF ME THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THESE FACTS ABOUT ME ARE THE PARAMETERS I LIVE MY LIFE AND EXERCISE MY FREEDOM WITHIN SEE BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING AND THIS GOES FOR ALL YOU OUT THERE
POD1000000022_S0000066 WHEN START TO TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALKED ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS
POD1000000022_S0000067 WE OFTEN SAY THINGS LIKE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING YOU CAN'T WRAP YOURSELF IN A PROTECTIVE COCOON AND THEN EMERGE A UNICORN IN THREE DAYS YOU CAN'T FLY TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AND LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
POD1000000022_S0000068 NO FREEDOM IS ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND IT'S THOSE LIMITATIONS THAT GIVE A LOT OF WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO IN LIFE ITS VALUE WE SEE THIS AND ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS OF ART YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WRITES A REALLY GOOD HAIKU
POD1000000022_S0000069 WE SEE IT AS GOOD NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE GREATEST WORDS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN POSSIBLY STRUNG TOGETHER KNOW THE BEAUTY OF A HAIKU IS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GIVEN AN ARTIST TOTAL FREEDOM WITHIN A SET OF LIMITATIONS THAT WE IMPOSE
POD1000000022_S0000070 FIVE SYLLABLES SEVEN SYLLABLES FIVE SYLLABLES GO IN OTHER WORDS THE LIMITATIONS ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES THE HAIKU BEAUTIFUL AND THIS APPLIES TO LIFE AS WELL
POD1000000022_S0000071 THE FACTICITY THAT YOU WERE BORN INTO YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL LIMITATIONS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO AFFECT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU WANT ME TO CHOOSE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE SO TRY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE IT'S A PIECE OF ART YOU'RE CREATING
POD1000000022_S0000072 YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINTS ARCHERS MAKE IN HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IS NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000073 UNCHANGING THING THAT YOU CAN POINT TO THE POINT THAT HE'S MAKING IS THAT WHO YOU ARE IS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CHANGE SOMETIMES SMALL CHANGES SOMETIMES BIGGER CHANGES BUT CHANGING AND INFLUX BUT DON'T GO EXTREME IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
POD1000000022_S0000074 DON'T START THINKING OF YOURSELF AS THIS ETHEREAL THING THAT CAN NEVER BE DEFINED AGAIN ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE WHEN YOU'RE FINALLY TURNED INTO TOTAL FACTICITY YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE CERTAIN FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND CERTAIN POSSIBILITIES AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO BRING ABOUT
POD1000000022_S0000075 UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE IS WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO
POD1000000022_S0000076 NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES ARE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000077 SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR SARTRE SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD
POD1000000022_S0000078 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT THINK ABOUT THE WAVE FOLLOWERS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS HAVE TRADITIONALLY LOOKED AT GOD WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE GOD WELL GOD IS PERFECT GOD IS IN THIS MOMENT EVERYTHING HE WILL EVER BE IF GOD HAD A JOB INTERVIEW IN THE PERSON ASKED HIM WHAT'S ONE THING HE CHANGE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000079 GOD LITERALLY DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL WITH THE SNAP OF HIS FINGERS HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS TO DO IN OTHER WORDS IN THIS OLD STYLE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF WHAT GOD IS ON ONE HAND
POD1000000022_S0000080 GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000081 AND IT'S ALSO NO COINCIDENCE THAT AS PEOPLE NAVIGATE THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF TACTICS THEY USE TO TURN THEMSELVES EITHER INTO SOMEBODY THAT IGNORES THEIR POSSIBILITIES AND ARE PERFECT AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW OR SOMEONE WHO IGNORES THE VERY REAL UNFORTUNATE FACTS ABOUT THEMSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000082 AND THEY STAY LOST IN THESE UNATTAINABLE DREAMS THEIR ENTIRE LIFE THIS IS THE CONTEXT WE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND A CONCEPT WE TALKED ABOUT WELL OVER A YEAR AGO ON THE ONE EPISODE WE DID ON SARTRE THE PRIMARY TACTIC THAT PEOPLE USE IN THEIR LIVES TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000083 OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH AND SARTRE LAYS OUT IN BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF
POD1000000022_S0000084 START TO TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE 1940S RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER
POD1000000022_S0000085 HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES STARTER CAN HELP A POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000086 HE SEEMS TO HAVE RELEGATED HIMSELF TO JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A WAITER HE'S GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS TRYING TO TURN HIMSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY JUST A WAITER AND NOTHING ELSE NOW EVEN THE WAITERS DON'T ACT LIKE THIS OFTEN IN TODAY'S WORLD
POD1000000022_S0000087 GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT STARTERS TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000088 HI I'M JOHN I'M GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU TODAY CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE IN THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTING FOR YOU GUYS YALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT NOW THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE
POD1000000022_S0000090 ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIEND'S KNOW HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINTS ARCHERS MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS
POD1000000022_S0000091 THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP AND ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY
POD1000000022_S0000092 I AM A LIBERTARIAN I AM A MORMON AND THAT'S THAT BUT WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO DO WITH THESE PROCLAMATIONS IS GIVE OURSELVES AN ESSENCE IN A WORLD WHERE EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE
POD1000000022_S0000093 ALL THESE THINGS ARE JUST US WANTING TO THINK ABOUT OURSELVES AS SOME STATIC THINGS SET IN STONE AND RUN FROM THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE NO WHEN WE TAKE AN HONEST LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES AT OUR DISPOSAL IT TERRIFIES US AND IT PRODUCES A FEELING CALLED NAUSEA
POD1000000022_S0000094 AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS STARTERS BEING AND NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000095 IS AN INESCAPABLE CONDITION OF BEING A HUMAN BEING AND THAT EVEN WHEN WE'RE SELF AWARE OF THE BAD FAITH WERE ENGAGING IN WE'RE STILL ENGAGING IN BAD FAITH IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS THE MAIN TEXT OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THAT IMPRESSION AND IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY SAD PICTURE
POD1000000022_S0000096 BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN HIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER
POD1000000022_S0000097 AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART 2 ON SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I
POD1000000022_S0000098 REALLY HERE'S THE THING WHEN IT COMES TO THESE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE JUST THINK GENERALLY ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE WHERE ARE THOSE THINGS LOCATED WHERE YOU LOOKING TO FIND THOSE
POD1000000022_S0000099 THOSE THINGS AREN'T HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOU MAY HAVE A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE OF THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE BUT NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH AND TELL YOURSELF A STORY ABOUT
POD1000000022_S0000100 SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED VIP ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000101 IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THEN WE ARE BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000102 JUST LIKE YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OURSELVES IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION IT'S THE CONGLOMERATION OF ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER ACTUALLY DONE IN YOUR LIFE
POD1000000022_S0000103 WHEN YOU WANT TO GET A SOLID ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I YOU DON'T REFERENCE THE STORY THAT YOU TELL YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD THAT'S CLOUDED BY ALL SORTS OF BAD FAITH AND WISHFUL THINKING LIKE THE GUY THAT THINKS HE WOULD TRY TO TAKE DOWN THE GUNMAN AT
POD1000000022_S0000104 NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND START TO SAYS IT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE CELL
POD1000000022_S0000105 IS THOUGH IT'S THIS THING INSIDE OF YOU AND YOU START LOOKING AT IT MORE ACCURATELY AS THIS ABSTRACTION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF US WHAT YOU INEVITABLY START TO REALIZE IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE WITHOUT REFERENCING THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE VIEW YOU
POD1000000022_S0000106 MORE THAN THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF BEING WITHOUT REFERENCING OTHER PEOPLE AND HERE'S WHAT HE'S GETTING IT SO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING BEING WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF BUT IT'S RIGHT HERE FAIRLY LATE IN BEING
POD1000000022_S0000107 NOTHINGNESS THE STARTER LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT
POD1000000022_S0000108 THIS IS STARTERS CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION
POD1000000022_S0000109 AND WHAT STARTER POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE
POD1000000022_S0000110 WHETHER I'M A NICE OR MEAN PERSON LOOK I MAY THINK OF MYSELF AS A NICE PERSON BUT IF EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON I ENCOUNTER ALL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE SAYS THAT I MEAN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I'M A MEAN PERSON THIS CONCEPT OF THE CELL
POD1000000022_S0000111 AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US IN WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US
POD1000000022_S0000112 WE'RE ALMOST ALWAYS BEING TURNED INTO PURE FACTICITY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S MINDS FOR EXAMPLE YOU EVER WALKED AROUND IN YOUR SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK MAYBE JUST GOT A NEW PAIR OF SHOES AND YOU THINK THEY LOOK WEIRD AND AS YOU'RE WALKING AROUND YOU FEEL LIKE EVERY PERSON THAT PASSES HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE THINKING
POD1000000022_S0000113 WOW WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY PICKED OUT THOSE SHOES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PERSON THAT DOESN'T CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE TURNING YOU INTO AN OBJECT AND THEIR SUBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD PURE FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000114 YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SUCH AS NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING
POD1000000022_S0000115 PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT STARTS WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000116 SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT WE EXIST ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT WILL THE INSIGHTS OTHER PEOPLE GIVE US ABOUT WHO WE ARE ARE NO DOUBT VALUABLE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DYNAMIC OF BEING FOR OTHERS WHAT I MEAN IS
POD1000000022_S0000117 JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY SEES YOU WEARING WEIRD CHOOSE ONE DAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOW WEIRD CHOOSE GUY IN PERPETUITY IN OTHER WORDS DON'T SLIP INTO BAD FAITH WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU NO MATTER HOW CONVENIENT IT MAY BE TO PRESCRIBE YOURSELF AN ESSENCE AND DENY YOUR
POD1000000022_S0000118 DON'T TURN YOURSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY AND JUST ACCEPT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU YOU ARE MAYBE YOU ARE WEIRD SHOES GUY RIGHT NOW BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE FUTURE BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS DON'T DENY YOUR FACTICITY DON'T TELL YOURSELF YOUR SHOES ARE FINE
POD1000000022_S0000119 DON'T TELL YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS OR THAT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU AT ALL OBVIOUSLY IT DOES THAT SLIPPING INTO ANOTHER KIND OF BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000120 SO TO SUM THIS UP I GUESS LOOK INTUITIVELY
POD1000000022_S0000121 IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WHO WE TRUST DEARLY BUT STARTED WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000123 PERSPECTIVE AND AT THE REASON IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR FRIENDS REINFORCE THIS PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE
POD1000000022_S0000124 IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USED TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000125 FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF AND YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU YOUR SMART ALL THE
POD1000000022_S0000126 OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTRE WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000127 OF COURSE WE'D GIVE THEM PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO OUR BIAS NARRATIVE OF
POD1000000022_S0000128 AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU
POD1000000022_S0000129 IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME

POD1000000027_S0000011 IT'S ABOUT A SCANDAL THAT ROCKED THE NBA AND TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW POWER RACE AND CELEBRITY INTERSECT IN MODERN SPORTS
POD1000000027_S0000013 FOR THIS SEASON WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH ESPN'S RAMONA SHELBURNE ONE OF OUR TOP NBA REPORTERS AN LA NATIVE AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN COVERING THIS STORY FROM THE MOMENT IT BROKE
POD1000000027_S0000014 RAMONA IS YOUR HOST FOR ALL FIVE EPISODES A QUICK WORD OF WARNING THIS SEASON CONTAINS MATURE SUBJECT MATTER AND LANGUAGE AND NOW COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK FROM THIRTY FOUR THIRTY AND THE UNDEFEATED THE STERLING AFFAIRS
POD1000000027_S0000016 SHELLY STERLING THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GOING TO RETURN SOME CLOTHES TO NEIMAN MARCUS WHEN SHE GOT IN HER MERCEDES BENZ STATION WAGON AND MADE THE DRIVE FROM MALIBU TO BEVERLY HILLS IT WAS EARLY IN THE SPRING OF 2014
POD1000000027_S0000017 AND EVEN THOUGH SHELLY WAS ALMOST 80 YEARS OLD SHE WAS STILL GOING INTO TOWN IS RICH PEOPLE CALL BEVERLY HILLS FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK IT'S HARD TO GUESS SHELLY'S AGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
POD1000000027_S0000018 BECAUSE SHE KEEPS HER HAIR THAT'S CONVINCING PALE BLOND AND HER FACE IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED DRIVING INTO BEVERLY HILLS IS BASICALLY LIKE ENTERING A STATE PARK FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS
POD1000000027_S0000019 THERE ARE THE ICONIC BROWN AND YELLOW SIGNS THAT LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENTERED A SPECIAL PLACE AND SHELLY STERLING AND HER HUSBAND DONALD OWN A TON OF IT
POD1000000027_S0000020 OVER THERE 60 OR MARRIAGE THE STERLING'S BUILT A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE IN THEIR HEYDAY THEY WERE THE LARGEST RESIDENTIAL LANDLORDS IN LA COUNTY
POD1000000027_S0000022 BUT MOST PEOPLE KNEW HER HUSBAND DONALD STERLING AS THE LONGTIME OWNER OF THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ONE OF THE WORST OWNERS IN ALL OF SPORTS HIS TEAM WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE NBA FOR DECADES
POD1000000027_S0000023 FOR SHELLEY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A JOT DOWN RODEO DRIVE TO RETURN SOME WILDLY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HER HER HUSBAND WAS ALSO AT NEIMAN MARCUS THAT DAY
POD1000000027_S0000024 WITH A WOMAN 49 YEARS HIS JUNIOR NAMED V STIVIANO SHE WASN'T THE FIRST MISTRESS NOT EVEN CLOSE BUT FEE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
POD1000000027_S0000026 SHELLY TOLD ME THAT STORY WHEN WE MET IN THE WINTER OF 2019 AT THE BEVERLY HILLS PLAZA HOTEL OR MY HOTEL AS SHE CALLS IT
POD1000000027_S0000027 SHELLY WAS 84 AT THE TIME BUT SHE CAN TELL THAT STORY OF THAT RUN IN WITH DONALD AND V FIVE YEARS EARLIER WITH EXACTING DETAIL
POD1000000027_S0000028 I HAPPENED TO BE THERE TO RETURN SOMETHING AND SHE WAS THERE WITH DONALD AND WITH SOME OTHER FRIENDS AND WE HAD A BIG CONFRONTATION SHE WAS VERY VERY VERY NASTY AND MEAN TO ME
POD1000000027_S0000029 WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SHE RAN INTO SHELLY I THINK AT NORDSTROM AND THEY STARTED TALKING AND I GUESS THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND
POD1000000027_S0000030 THAT'S FEAST OF LLANOS LAWYER MAGNA HOORAY AND WHEN I TOLD SHELLY STERLING HIS VERSION OF THE STORY SHE SCOFFED
POD1000000027_S0000031 IT WAS AT LEHMAN MARCUS
POD1000000027_S0000032 AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY THAT SHELLY TOOK THE TIME TO CORRECT HIM MEAN HERE'S A WOMAN TALKING TO A FEMALE REPORTER BUT HER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITY WHO CARES WHETHER YOU CONFRONT YOUR HUSBAND'S MISTRESS OUTSIDE OF NEIMAN MARCUS OR NORA TEASE
POD1000000027_S0000033 BUT THE DETAILS MATTER HERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT MEETING OUTSIDE OF NEIMAN MARCUS THAT PETTY SQUABBLE BETWEEN A WIFE AND HER HUSBAND'S MISTRESS SET OFF A CHAIN OF EVENTS
POD1000000027_S0000034 BUT IN THE END LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS THE CONTROVERSY THAT FORCED THE NBA TO FINALLY DEAL WITH DONALD STERLING AFTER DECADES OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AND HAD RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LEAGUE
POD1000000027_S0000036 THIS IS THE STERLING AFFAIRS FROM 3430 PODCASTS IN THE UNDEFEATED I'M RAMONA SHELBURNE
POD1000000027_S0000039 I'VE COVERED BASKETBALL IN LA FOR A LONG TIME THE NBA IS A LEAGUE OF HUGE PERSONALITIES AND EVEN BIGGER EGOS FIGHTING FOR POWER AND IF YOU WANT THE REAL SCORE THAT'S THE GAME YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
POD1000000027_S0000041 I LEARNED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT THERE'S NO OTHER OWNER AND BASKETBALL WITH QUITE THE SAME PERSONALITY YOUR EGO IS DONALD STERLING STERLING WASN'T A BASKETBALL GUY HE WAS A PERSONAL INJURY LAWYER AND THEN HE GOT FILTHY RICH OFF OF REAL ESTATE
POD1000000027_S0000043 THAT'S WHAT HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT
POD1000000027_S0000045 I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY HE EVEN KEPT THE CLIPPERS WHEN HIS REPUTATION IS AN OWNER WAS SO BAD BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT DEEP DOWN HE WANTED WHAT EVERYONE IN THE GAME IS SUPPOSED TO WANT TO WIN
POD1000000027_S0000047 BUT RICH PEOPLE LIKE DONALD STERLING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR RICH PEOPLE DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD AS THE REST OF US DON'T PLAY BY THE SAME RULES WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IT'S LIKE YOUR RUBBER EVERYTHING JUST BOUNCES OFF OF YOU
POD1000000027_S0000048 EVEN THREE DECADES OF DRIVING AN NBA FRANCHISE INTO THE GROUND WHEN YOU'RE AS RICH AS DONALD AND SHELLY YOU GET TO TELL YOURSELF THAT EVERYTHING IS FABULOUS

POD1000000027_S0000073 SHE WOULD STALK SHELLY SHE WOULD WATCH WHERE SHELLY WOULD GO AND THEN SHE'D SHOW UP AND I DO REMEMBER THE ONE TIME SHE WENT INTO THE RESTROOM WHERE SHELLEY WAS JUST PARADED AROUND SHOWED OFF HERSELF THEN SHELLY LOCKED OUT
POD1000000027_S0000074 CLIPPERS GAMES THE ENTIRE EXTENDED STERLING UNIVERSE WAS USUALLY THERE AND USUALLY JUST FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER SOMETIMES SHELLY AND DONALD SAT IN THEIR COURTSIDE SEATS TOGETHER AND VSAT AND HER SEEDS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE COURT

POD1000000027_S0000077 NOBODY LIKED HER WE KNEW WHY SHE WAS HERE AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY TO BEGIN WITH BUT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T OUR PLACE TO SPEAK ON IT AT THE TIME
POD1000000027_S0000078 CLIPPERS EMPLOYEES OFTEN GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BIZARRE TRIANGLE SHELLEY WOULD CALL A TEAM PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER DEMANDING THAT V NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING AND THEN DONALD WOULD CALL ROSER AND ASK HIM TO LEAVE FOR TICKETS FOR HER
POD1000000027_S0000079 THESE WERE RELATIONSHIPS BEGGING TO IMPLODE BUT NONE OF THE ENTANGLED EVER TRIED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM DONALD SHELLEY V EACH KEPT PUSHING EACH OTHER WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BREAK
POD1000000027_S0000080 WELL THE BREAKING STARTED ON CHRISTMAS DAY 2012 BE CALLED THE STERLING HOUSE ASKING TO SPEAK TO DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000081 WE WERE ALL SITTING DOWN CHRISTMAS DAY HAVING DINNER AND SHE CALLED
POD1000000027_S0000082 CHARLIE WAS MORTIFIED THE FAMILY WAS SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE WAITING FOR DONALD AS HE'S PACING ON THE TENNIS COURTS OUTSIDE FIGHTING WITH HIS MISTRESS
POD1000000027_S0000083 I DON'T KNOW THEY HAD SOME ARGUMENT AND THE FAMILY HEARD ABOUT IT YOU KNOW IT JUST IT WASN'T A GOOD SCENE
POD1000000027_S0000085 THE FIGHT WAS SHELLEY STARTED WHEN HE HUNG UP
POD1000000027_S0000086 NOT THAT THAT WAS UNCOMMON EVEN WITHOUT FEE THEY FOUGHT OFTEN BUT THIS WAS ESCALATING SHELLY AND DONALD'S YOUNGEST SON SCOTT HAD TO STEP IN BEFORE IT GOT PHYSICAL HE CONFRONTED HIS FATHER AND DEMANDED HE STOP THIS NONSENSE WITH V
POD1000000027_S0000087 AND STOP DISRESPECTING HIS MOTHER LIKE THIS
POD1000000027_S0000089 IT WAS A BIG MOMENT BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT
POD1000000027_S0000091 A WEEK LATER SCOTT DIED
POD1000000027_S0000093 IT WAS FIRST REPORTED TO BE A PULMONARY EMBOLISM BUT LATER REVEALED TO BE AN OVERDOSE HE WAS 32
POD1000000027_S0000095 AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE THIS BUT YOU LOST A CHILD
POD1000000027_S0000096 NO
POD1000000027_S0000097 RIGHT AROUND THERE
POD1000000027_S0000098 JANUARY FIRST
POD1000000027_S0000100 SHELLEY WAS DEVASTATED
POD1000000027_S0000101 I WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LIVING
POD1000000027_S0000103 IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE FIGHT WITH V WAS A LAST VOLATILE MOMENT BETWEEN DONALD AND SCOTT
POD1000000027_S0000105 WHEN SCOTT DIED DONALD STAYED WITH FEE INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO HIS WIFE SHE GRIEVED IT'S TOO MUCH SHE KICKED ON OUT OF THE HOUSE
POD1000000027_S0000107 SHOWING NEEDED BREATHING ROOM AND I THINK DON HAD PUSHED THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE TOO FAR
POD1000000027_S0000108 I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WE PROBABLY WERE GOING TO BE GETTING A DIVORCE
POD1000000027_S0000110 BUT SHY AND DONALD HAVE BEEN TOGETHER TOO LONG BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER AT TOO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MONEY INTERTWINED
POD1000000027_S0000112 THEY DID NOT DIVORCE THE SITUATION SIMPLY CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS DONALD SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME WITH ME
POD1000000027_S0000114 PLUS SHELLY WAS STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE GIFTS BE POSTED PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM BE DRIVING THE 240 THOUSAND DOLLAR RED FERRARI THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT HER
POD1000000027_S0000115 AND THE RANGE ROVER AND THE TWO BENTLEY'S SHELLEY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT VIA 1.8 MILLION DOLLAR DUPLEX
POD1000000027_S0000116 WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD PAID FOR ALL THE CARS AND HE PAID FOR THIS HOUSE I WAS FURIOUS
POD1000000027_S0000117 IT WAS THAT ANGER THAT SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH A RETURNS ON THE FATEFUL DAY THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND V IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER OR ARGUED BUT THIS TIME SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH
POD1000000027_S0000118 AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO SUE HER
POD1000000027_S0000119 MARCH 7 2014 SHELLY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST V STIVIANO SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000121 DONALD AND SHELLY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST
POD1000000027_S0000122 EVERY DIME THAT THE STERLING SPENT CAUSE EACH OF THEM A NICKEL THERE FOR SHELLEY ARGUED THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS IS IT WAS HIS
POD1000000027_S0000123 SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME WELL YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLING'S CALLING A LAWYER IS HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
POD1000000027_S0000124 TO SAY THEY'RE LITIGIOUS IS LIKE SAYING THERE'S TRAFFIC ON THE 405 AND BESIDES SUING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT HAD PROVEN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE SERLING'S OVER THE YEARS
POD1000000027_S0000125 MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS OR THE STOMACH TO BATTLE THEM IN COURT THEY'D SETTLE BEFORE THEY STARVED
POD1000000027_S0000126 SHE KEPT SAYING TO DONALD YOU BETTER HAVE A DROPPED THE LAWSUIT AND HE'D SAY OH SHE WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE'S JUST DOING IT FOR A FACT AND SHE SAYS WELL HE BETTER DROPPED THE LAWSUIT
POD1000000027_S0000127 BUT HERE'S HOW THE LAWSUIT THE COURTROOM PRODUCT OF A BEDROOM DISPUTE REALLY CAME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR SOME TIME NOW HE HAD BEEN RECORDING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD

POD1000000027_S0000134 PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE PLEASE
POD1000000027_S0000135 IT RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE BORING EVEN BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS AND CAPTURE DECIDED DONALD THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR
POD1000000027_S0000136 YOU DON'T KNOW THAT MAYBE YOU'RE STUPID
POD1000000027_S0000137 NO MATTER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE TAPES WAS THEY BECAME SOMETHING WE COULD USE AS BLACKMAIL BECAUSE V STIVIANO HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000138 SHE WANTED ME TO DROP THE LAWSUIT
POD1000000027_S0000139 V SAYS THE DONALD I WANT THAT BITCH WIFE OF YOURS LAWSUIT DISMISSED

POD1000000027_S0000179 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE TAPE WAS SENT TO THE CLIPPERS UNTIL SOMEBODY AT A GAME TOLD ME THAT THEY SAID THEY RECEIVED A TAPE FROM HER
POD1000000027_S0000180 AND I SAID WELL WHAT IS THE TAPE ABOUT SO I SAID TO ANDY ANDY ROSA I SAID ANDY WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS AND HE SAYS OH WELL SHE'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING

POD1000000027_S0000182 DONALD AND SHELLY HAD CLEANED UP THEIR OWN MESSES FOR SIX DECADES HE FIGURED THEY'D EVENTUALLY MAKE THIS ONE GO AWAY TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T SHELLY TOLD HER LAWYERS ABOUT THE TAPES
POD1000000027_S0000183 AND THEY IN TURN WENT TO VISA LAWYER AND DEMANDED TO HEAR THEM THAT'S WHEN V STIVIANO MADE HER BIG MOVE
POD1000000027_S0000185 I GOT A CALL BY A TRUSTED CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE WHO SAID YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS
POD1000000027_S0000186 MIKE WALTERS WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT TMZ AT THE TIME NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN CELEBRITY NEWS SITE THE
POD1000000027_S0000187 THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY WHO'S DONALD STERLING I HAD HEARD THE NAME I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS
POD1000000027_S0000188 EVEN FOR SOMEONE FROM TMZ WHOSE JOB WAS BREAKING THE INTERNET WITH THE JUICIEST MOST CONTROVERSIAL STORIES THIS FELT LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
POD1000000027_S0000190 I RECEIVE THE AUDIO AND SAID OH MY GOD
POD1000000027_S0000193 IT WAS THE MOST REPULSIVE DISGUSTING

POD1000000027_S0000197 AUDIO OR MOMENT THAT I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFETIME COME OUT OF SOMEBODY'S MOUTH THAT THEN ONCE I REALIZED WHO THEY WERE HOW MUCH IMPACT THAT MAY HAVE
POD1000000027_S0000199 BUT NO ONE IN THE CLIPPERS WORLD SEEM TO REALIZE
POD1000000027_S0000201 FACT IS SHELLY AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION HEARD THE RECORDING AND DECIDED NOT TO ACT ON IT OR WERE NEPAL'S ENOUGH TO ACT ON IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A SPLASH THIS TAPE COULD
POD1000000027_S0000203 I THINK THIS DEALS WITH VERY TOUCHY SUBJECTS LIKE RACISM SEXISM
POD1000000027_S0000205 THINGS THAT TOUCH EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY SO I KNEW WITH ALL OF THAT COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS ON TAPE

POD1000000027_S0000276 OUTSIDE THE HOTEL WAS EVEN MORE CHAOTIC THE WHOLE WORLD WANTED REACTION CLIPPERS TEAM SECURITY IF EYES PLAYERS AND STAFFERS TO STAY INSIDE THEIR HOTEL ROOMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ON LOCKDOWN
POD1000000027_S0000277 WHEN I CAME OUT I REMEMBER IT JUST BEING CHAOS JUST FROM THEN ON IT WAS JUST THAT THAT'S ALL ANYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT

POD1000000027_S0000286 IF IT WAS STERLING ON THOSE TAPES IF THEY HADN'T BEEN DOCTORED OR ALTERED SILVER KNEW HE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY THE LEAGUE WAS OUTRAGED
POD1000000027_S0000287 BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THOSE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AND ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON
POD1000000027_S0000289 IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE AS ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF V STIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON AT SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC
POD1000000027_S0000290 THE GUY WHO TURNED THE LAKERS INTO A DYNASTY WHO'D FOUGHT OFF HIV THAT'S THE GUY DONALD STERLING TOLD HIS MISTRESS WASN'T WELCOME AT HIS GAMES

POD1000000027_S0000294 EVEN THE FAMOUSLY A POLITICAL MICHAEL JORDAN VOICED HIS OUTRAGE
POD1000000027_S0000295 MICHAEL JORDAN WEIGHT IN THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE NBA OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THE KIND OF RACISM AND HATRED THAT MR. STERLING ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED WE CANNOT TOLERATE MUST NOT TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION AT ANY LEVEL
POD1000000027_S0000296 BUT THE STORY WAS BIGGER THAN THE NBA IT REVEALED SOMETHING RAW AND UGLY IT TRIGGERED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
POD1000000027_S0000298 IT'S LIKE WHAT ONE OF THE PAPARAZZI WHO WAS TAILING DONALD AND SHELLY TOLD ME IT HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS SEX MONEY SPORTS POLITICS GREED RACISM

POD1000000027_S0000305 I DON'T KNOW IT'S MY JOB WELL THEN IT'S MY JOB
POD1000000027_S0000306 BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT STERLING
POD1000000027_S0000308 I SUSPECT THE DAMN DAY IS GOING TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED AND IN RESOLVING THIS YOU KNOW WE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO WRESTLE WITH THE LEGACY OF OF RACE
POD1000000027_S0000309 THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER MORE SHAMEFUL
POD1000000027_S0000311 A PLANTATION MENTALITY THAT'S AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY
POD1000000027_S0000313 THAT'S AN NBA OWNER A MAN WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING ON FOR MORE THAN NINE MINUTES SPEWING THE MOST VILE OF RACIST THOUGHTS A WHITE OWNER WHOSE 20 MAN ROSTER WAS STACKED WITH A MAJORITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS
POD1000000027_S0000314 INCLUDING RYAN HOLLINS
POD1000000027_S0000315 THOSE WORDS HURT WHEN YOU HEAR I DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT WILL THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT PLAY FOR YOU THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BUY YOUR TICKETS THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BLEED JUST LIKE YOU BRO
POD1000000027_S0000317 EARTHQUAKES BOTH REAL AND METAPHORICAL HAPPENED SUDDENLY BUT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT SUDDEN THE TREMOR IS A PRODUCT OF TENSIONS THAT BUILD UP FOR YEARS UNTIL THE FAULT LINES SIMPLY BREAK
POD1000000027_S0000318 LOS ANGELES IT'S ON TO FAULT LINES SAN ANDREAS AND RACE ALL OF US KNOW IT WE LIVE WITH IT DONALD STERLING WAS ANOTHER
POD1000000027_S0000319 ANYONE WHO PLAYED FOR HIM OR WORK FOR HIM OR COVERED HIM IN THE PRESS OR LIVED IN ONE OF HIS HUNDREDS OF APARTMENTS ON THE ONE HAND KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE BLEW UP THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH STERLING WERE WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED
POD1000000027_S0000320 BUT LIKE MOST INSANELY WEALTHY WHITE MEN IN AMERICA IT'S ALL HAD MANAGED TO WIGGLE BULLY AND FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF ALL HE KNOW HOW TO PLAY AS LEVERAGE AND POWERED OUTLAST HIS ADVERSARIES AND WHEN HE CAN CALL IT THAT
POD1000000027_S0000321 BUT THIS TIME FELT DIFFERENT
POD1000000027_S0000323 I REMEMBER I HAD SAID THIS IS REALLY BAD REALLY BAD AND I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE SHOCKED
POD1000000027_S0000325 THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WERE SHOCKED BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
POD1000000029_S0000001 FACEBOOK'S HAD 15 MONTHS OF QUOTE FRESH HELL BUT 2.1 BILLION STILL USE IT OR INSTAGRAM OR WHATSAPP OR MESSENGER EVERY DAY
POD1000000029_S0000002 FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M JACK STEWART IN FROM HOLLYWOOD
POD1000000029_S0000004 DESPITE THE PRIVACY SCANDALS THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THE ACCUSATIONS OF DESTROYING DEMOCRACY THIS WEEK FACEBOOK REPORTED ITS ADVERTISING REVENUE AND GLOBAL USERS ARE GROWING
POD1000000029_S0000005 IN THIS WEEK'S QUALITY ASSURANCE WE TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO WHY IN HIS EARLY YEARS FACEBOOK PRIORITIZED GROWTH OVER EVERYTHING ELSE
POD1000000029_S0000006 NEARLY EVERY CRISIS FACEBOOK NOW FACES STEMS FROM THAT NICHOLAS THOMPSON EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED SAYS THAT'S LEFT MANAGEMENT NAVIGATE A METAPHORICAL MINEFIELD
POD1000000029_S0000007 THERE WAS A LOT OF UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE THAT THEY WERE INEVITABLY GOING TO STEP ON AT SOME
POD1000000029_S0000008 HE'S AN AUTHOR ON THE MAGAZINE'S LATEST COVER STORY WHICH GOES BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE TROUBLED COMPANY HE SAYS FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY SOLID FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
POD1000000029_S0000009 NUMBER ONE THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS MODEL THEY CAME UP WITH THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LOTS OF CHANGES THEY JUST BUILT AN AMAZING BUSINESS MODEL AND THE MARGINAL COST OF BRINGING A NEW ADVERTISERS ARE VERY LOW
POD1000000029_S0000010 SECONDLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG EVER MADE WAS TO BUY INSTAGRAM AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK OR IF THEY DISTRUST FACEBOOK THEY DON'T DISTRUST INSTAGRAM SO INSTAGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW
POD1000000029_S0000011 SO THEY MAKE LOTS OF MONEY OFF OF CORE FACEBOOK THEY HAVE LOTS OF USER GROWTH ON INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP AND THE BUSINESS IS DOING GREAT
POD1000000029_S0000012 YOU WOULD THINK AT SOME POINT THAT MAYBE ADVERTISERS WOULD START TO PUSH BACK I MEAN IF FACEBOOK'S REPUTATION HAS REALLY TAKEN THIS REALLY HUGE DENT THAT IT APPEARS AT HOUSE WHY DO PEOPLE STILL WANT TO ADVERTISE WITH IT
POD1000000029_S0000013 WELL BECAUSE THE ADVERTISING CONTINUES TO WORK IF IT'S SOME POINTS PEOPLE HAD AN ICKY FEELING WHEN THEY USE FACEBOOK AND THEREFORE THE ADS ARE LESS EFFECTIVE THEN ADVERTISERS WILL LEAVE
POD1000000029_S0000014 BUT AT THIS MOMENT FACEBOOK ALLOWS YOU TO VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGET SPECIFIC USERS IN WAYS THAT YOU CANNOT ON OTHER PLATFORMS AND FOR LOTS OF ADVERTISERS THAT'S JUST A DEAL THAT'S TOO GOOD TO PASS UP
POD1000000029_S0000015 NOW FACEBOOK IS ANTICIPATING WHAT IT SAYS UP TO A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WE HEARD THAT FROM IT THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW IT'S HANDLED SOME OF THESE PRIVACY ISSUES
POD1000000029_S0000016 WILL THEY EVEN FEEL THAT IS THE QUESTION THEY HAVE SO MUCH CASH ON HAND IS IT A BIG DEAL
POD1000000029_S0000017 NO SO FACEBOOK PUT OUT IN THEIR EARNINGS CALL THEY SAID THAT THEY ANTICIPATE A 325 BILLION DOLLAR FINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THE FTC HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH THEM OR IF FACEBOOK IS JUST TRYING TO SET EXPECTATIONS AS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC
POD1000000029_S0000018 I WOULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT FACEBOOK IS HIT WITH A 10 BILLION DOLLAR FINE OR A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR FINE REGARDLESS TO YOUR QUESTION EVEN IF IT IS AT THE HIGHER END WHETHER IT'S 5 OR 10 OR 20 IT'S TINY
POD1000000029_S0000019 THEIR MARKET CAP IS UP I BELIEVE 40 BILLION DOLLARS AS WE TALK THIS MORNING SO IT'S NOT A HUGE HIT TO THEM OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND NOT HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BUT THEY WILL BE FINE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS NUMBER COMES OUT
POD1000000029_S0000020 THE THING THEY REALLY WORRY ABOUT IS ANTITRUST IF THERE IS ANTITRUST REGULATION AND IT COMES DOWN HARD ON THEM THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET DROP DRAMATICALLY
POD1000000029_S0000021 WHAT ARE THE STAKES FOR FACEBOOK'S LEADERSHIP AROUND ALL OF THESE SCANDALS THAT THE FAKE NEWS THE OFFENSIVE CONTENT THE PRIVACY YOU KNOW YOU DETAILED THAT THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE 30,000 MODERATORS NOW DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK
POD1000000029_S0000022 YES ABSOLUTELY FACEBOOK IS TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS BUSINESS RISK SO THEY'RE TWO REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS IN THERE SO NUMBER ONE IS DO THEY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK ABSOLUTELY ARE THEY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO COUNTER FAKE NEWS AND ALL OF THE MANIPULATION ON THE PLATFORM
POD1000000029_S0000023 ABSOLUTELY WHAT ARE THE STAKES TO THEIR BUSINESS THERE ARE VERY HIGH SCANDAL CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY THERE COULD BE REAL CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD WHAT ARE THE STAKES SPECIFICALLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT MEANING MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG TO PEOPLE WHO WE MOST ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMPANY
POD1000000029_S0000024 FOR ZUCKERBERG HE'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO HE HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE SHARES HE'S APPOINTED HIS FRIENDS AS BOARD MEMBERS HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION
POD1000000029_S0000025 WHENEVER HE WANTS TO GO AND RUN THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE OR JUST GO BE A INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT LEADER OR DO BILL GATES TYPE THINGS HE WILL GO CHOOSE TO DO THAT FOR SANDBURG IT'S TOUGHER
POD1000000029_S0000026 AND THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE SHE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED OR WHERE SHE MIGHT BE IN BIG TROUBLE ZUCKERBERG HAS EXPRESSED HIS LOYALTY TO HER
POD1000000029_S0000027 BUT AS THE SCANDALS MULTIPLIED AND AS THEY STARTED TO TOUCH HER IN A WAY THEY NEVER HAD BEFORE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER POSITION WAS AT RISK AND IT IS ALSO CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE PUBLIC REPUTATION OF BOTH OF THEM HAS DROPPED
POD1000000029_S0000028 YEAR AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THEM AS POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES NOW THERE'S NOT A CHANCE
POD1000000029_S0000029 WHAT ABOUT THE MORALE IN THE WIDER COMPANY IN THE WAKE OF ALL OF THIS DO YOU GET THE FEELING FROM THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO IN YOUR REPORTING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE FAIRLY SATISFIED THERE AND I'M LAUGHING EVEN AS I SAY THAT OR IS THERE A WHOLE LOT OF INTERNAL CHAOS AT THIS COMPANY
POD1000000029_S0000030 THERE IS A LOT MORE EMPLOYEE DISSATISFACTION THAN THERE WAS TWO YEARS
POD1000000029_S0000031 GO THERE LOTS OF EMPLOYEES WERE TALK TO YOU THERE WHO SAY OH THIS PLACE IS GREAT IT'S COOL YOU KNOW THE MEDIA HATES US BUT THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM I'M HAPPY AND THEY'RE BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW WE DESERVE A LOT OF THE HATRED WE'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES
POD1000000029_S0000032 WE TRAMPLED ON PEOPLE'S PRIVACIES AND YOU KNOW I REGRET ALL THAT WE'VE DONE I TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING TO WORK THERE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE HALO THAT IT DID TWO YEARS AGO
POD1000000029_S0000033 THEY STILL PAY YOU WELL THE FACT THAT THE STOCK CONTINUES TO GO UP IS GREAT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPTIONS
POD1000000029_S0000034 BUT IT IS A LESS EXCITING PLACE TO WORK AND THAT IS ONE OF THE TRUE RISKS FOR THE COMPANY AND ONE OF THE MOST ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR FACEBOOK
POD1000000029_S0000035 DID ANY PART IN THIS REPORTING PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE SPENT ON FACEBOOK DIRECTLY NOW DID ANYTHING REALLY SURPRISE YOU
POD1000000029_S0000036 THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC STORY THAT STUNNED ME AND THAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE TWO FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM KEVIN SYSTROM AND MY KRIEGER
POD1000000029_S0000037 AND WHEN FRED VOGELSTEIN AND I STARTED REPORTING THE STORY WE MADE A LIST OF THE MYSTERIES WE WANTED TO SOLVE THAT WAS AT THE VERY TOP I HAD THEY LEFT IT SEEMS STRANGE THEY HAD LEFT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEPTEMBER
POD1000000029_S0000038 NO ONE KNEW WHY AND LAID IN THE REPORTING MONTHS INTO REPORTING THE STORY WE FINALLY LEARNED THE FULL STORY AND THAT IS THAT ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM THEY HAD GROWN FRUSTRATED WITH ZUCKERBERG INCREASED MEDDLING
POD1000000029_S0000039 THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT INSTAGRAM WAS GOING TO BE FURTHER MERGED WITH WHATSAPP AND WITH FACEBOOK AND THERE WAS REAL TENSION OVER INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH
POD1000000029_S0000040 AND THERE WAS A SENSE AMONG SOME PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK THAT INSTAGRAMS GROWTH WAS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE FACEBOOK AND THAT LED TO ALL KINDS OF TENSIONS AND THEN A BIG FIGHT AT THE END OF JULY AND A MOMENT WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG
POD1000000029_S0000041 ACCORDING TO PEOPLE YOU OBSERVING ALL OF THIS MARK ZUCKERBERG ASKED ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES TO DRAW UP A LIST OF ALL THE WAYS THAT FACEBOOK SUPPORTED INSTAGRAM THE WAY IT DROVE USERS TOWARDS INSTAGRAM
POD1000000029_S0000042 AND THEN HE GAVE THE LIST TO KEVIN SYSTROM AND SAID WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL THIS AND ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY SYSTEM REACTED QUITE BADLY TO THAT AND THEN WENT ON PATERNITY LEAVE CAME BACK AND SAID I'M DONE HERE
POD1000000029_S0000043 AND SO THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO US WAS THAT THE DEPARTURE OF SYSTEM IN KRIEGER WHICH HADN'T COME OUT BEFORE WAS MUCH TENSOR MUCH TENSER THAN I HAD BELIEVED WHEN I BEGAN REPORTING THE STORY
POD1000000029_S0000044 NICK THOMPSON EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED FOR CONTEXT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE WOULD BE A RECORD TECH PENALTY IN THE U.S. BEATING THE 22 MILLION THAT GOOGLE HAD TO PAY IN 2012
POD1000000029_S0000046 AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS A GOOD EXPLAINER ON WHY BOTH FACEBOOK AND THE FTC WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A CHUNKY FINE ONE ENDS UP LOOKING STRONG THE OTHER LOOKS ACCOUNTABLE BUT REALLY NOTHING MUCH CHANGES
POD1000000029_S0000047 EUROPEAN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN TOUGHER ON TECH COMPANIES GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ALL HAVE TO DO MORE TO TACKLE FAKE NEWS TO SATISFY THEM AND THEY WANT TO SEE PROGRESS AHEAD OF EU ELECTIONS NEXT MONTH THAT'S ACCORDING TO REUTERS
POD1000000029_S0000048 AND EVEN CANADA IS GETTING IN ON THE ACTION ACCORDING TO THE CBC THIS WEEK PRIVACY REGULATORS THEIR SAY FACEBOOK BROKE SEVERAL LAWS OVER UNAUTHORIZED DATA ACCESS THEY PLAN TO TAKE THE COMPANY TO COURT
POD1000000029_S0000049 IF YOU ENJOYED MARK ZUCKERBERG TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS HERE IN THE US WITH HIS SINGING COMEBACKS LIKE SENATOR WE RUN ADS THEN MAYBE YOU'LL ENJOY HEARING MORE DIRECTLY FROM MR. ZUCKERBERG HIMSELF
POD1000000029_S0000050 I MEAN FACEBOOK WAS ACCUSED OF NOT BEING OPEN ENOUGH I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW DEEP INTO THE HEADS OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BUT SUCK DOES HAVE A PODCAST NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU LISTEN I'M JUST GIVING YOU THIS INFORMATION

POD1000000033_S0000007 LIKE AN ALABAMA FOR EXAMPLE BROADBAND SPEED IS DEFINED AS ONLY 10 MEGABITS PER SECOND IF YOUR NETWORK IS BUSY THAT'S FAIRLY FAST ENOUGH TO STREAM NETFLIX IN HIGH DEF
POD1000000033_S0000008 KATHERINE DO IT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS SHE TOLD ME STATE POLICY IS A HUGE DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING BROADBAND ACCESS
POD1000000033_S0000009 STATE POLICY MATTERS BECAUSE LACK OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND IS A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT IT IS FELT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STATES HAVE TAKEN A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO CLOSING GAPS IN ACCESS PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS
POD1000000033_S0000010 WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN LEGISLATION SINCE 2015 AND WHAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS NOT ONLY DO STATE POLICYMAKERS SEE AND FEEL THAT IMMEDIATE URGENCY OF LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS
POD1000000033_S0000011 US THEY'RE SAYING IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINGS LIKE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OUR STATE TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SETTING GOALS AND THEN THEY'RE LAYING OUT A PATH AND A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS
POD1000000033_S0000012 LET'S JUST DIVE INTO SOME OF WHAT IS IN THE TOOL SOME OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES ARE TAKING LIKE COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
POD1000000033_S0000013 SO GOING INTO THIS RESEARCH WE KNEW THAT STATES FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND INCREASING ACCESS TO BROADBAND BUT WE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE ALSO TAKING SIMILAR APPROACHES BUT ADAPTING THEM TO THEIR NEEDS THAT'S REALLY WHERE THOSE CATEGORIES CAME FROM THOSE GROUPINGS
POD1000000033_S0000014 IF YOU LOOK AT GOALS FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THEIR STATEWIDE BROADBAND GOALS ARE FOCUSED ON BORDER TO BORDER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
POD1000000033_S0000015 THEN YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HAS A GOAL TO CONNECT 98% OF THE POPULATION AND EACH ONE OF ITS ROUGHLY 20 REGIONS
POD1000000033_S0000016 HOW DO YOU HOPE THAT A TOOL LIKE THIS CAN HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF BROADBAND ACCESS
POD1000000033_S0000017 WELL THIS TOOL IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STEP IN OUR ONGOING RESEARCH ON HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING GAPS IN BROADBAND ACCESS SO FOR US THIS WAS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT 50 STATE LANDSCAPE OF BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT LAWS
POD1000000033_S0000018 AND IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR OUR NEXT LEVEL OF RESEARCH WHICH IS A DEEPER EXAMINATION OF HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN ACCESS
POD1000000033_S0000019 WELL WE HOPE THOUGH IS THAT USERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL TO LEARN WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT
POD1000000033_S0000020 KATHERINE DEWITT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS WE'VE GOT A LINK TO THAT NEW TOOL AND SOME ANALYSIS ABOUT SPENDING PER STATE AT OUR WEBSITE MARKETPLACE TECH DOT ORG
POD1000000033_S0000022 AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS SO THIS TOOL IS SUPER NEW OBVIOUSLY AND PEW HOPES THAT POLICYMAKERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL JUMP IN AND START CREATING SOME MORE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON AND OF COURSE THEY'LL BE PUBLISHING THEIR OWN PIECES
POD1000000033_S0000023 THE FIRST ONE THAT I MENTIONED THERE IS ABOUT HOW STATES FUND THEIR BROADBAND PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S GRANTS OR LOANS OR GENERAL FUND KIND OF THINGS OR SOME CREATIVE FUNDING
POD1000000033_S0000024 APPARENTLY ILLINOIS MAKES INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS PAY INTO A SPECIAL COFFER CALLED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ELIMINATION FUND AND IT USES THAT TO PAY FOR BROADBAND BUILD OUT
POD1000000033_S0000025 AND IN VIRGINIA A LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH TOBACCO PRODUCERS IS PAYING TO BUILD MORE INTERNET
POD1000000033_S0000026 LIKE I'M NOT SAYING THIS ISN'T A LITTLE WONKY OVER HERE BUT IT IS INTERESTING ALSO I GOT TO BE HONEST I'M STILL HUNG UP ON THAT 10 MEGABITS PER SECOND IN ALABAMA AND PROBABLY SOME OTHER STATES TOO I HAVEN'T MADE IT THROUGH THE ENTIRE TOOL YET
POD1000000033_S0000027 BUT ALABAMA'S REGULATION ALSO SAYS ISPS CAN CALL THEIR UPLOAD SPEEDS BROADBAND AT ONE MEGABIT PER SECOND SO BASICALLY IF YOU'RE AT HOME TRYING TO UPLOAD SOME PHOTOS TO FACEBOOK OR ANYTHING TO THE CLOUD EVER
POD1000000033_S0000028 YOU'D BE DOING THAT AT SPEEDS 10 TIMES SLOWER THAN THE SLOWEST 4G CELL PHONE CONNECTION SET IT AND FORGET IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL NIGHT
POD1000000033_S0000029 NOW THE SPEED QUESTION IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT EVEN THOUGH PUGH IS USING THE 25 MEGABIT PER SECOND SPEED GUIDELINE WHICH IS SET BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION NETWORK CONGESTION USUALLY MEANS ACTUAL SPEEDS ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT FAST
POD1000000033_S0000030 AND AGAIN A 4G PHONE CONNECTION IS FASTER THAN THAT ON THE BEST PROVIDERS
POD1000000033_S0000031 IT IS SUCH A BIG DISCREPANCY THAT WHILE PEW SAYS 21 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T HAVE BROADBAND MICROSOFT PUT OUT ITS OWN MAP OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS BACK IN APRIL
POD1000000033_S0000032 IT SAID THE REAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHOUT APPROPRIATELY FAST INTERNET ACCESS FOR TODAY'S ECONOMY IS MORE LIKE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE
POD1000000033_S0000034 BOLLYWOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH
POD1000000033_S0000036 THIS IS A
POD1000000038_S0000001 LET'S TAKE A BREAK FROM REAL LIFE FOR A MOMENT TO VISIT THESE SOMEWHAT NEAR FUTURE ON TV
POD1000000038_S0000002 ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT'S KIND OF DARK TOO
POD1000000038_S0000003 FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M MOLLY
POD1000000038_S0000005 THE BBC HBO SHOW YEARS AND YEARS COMBINES THE POLITICS ECONOMY AND TECH OF 2019 AND IMAGINES HOW IT ALL MIGHT EVOLVE OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS
POD1000000038_S0000006 EMMA THOMPSON IS IN IT AS A CELEBRITY BRITISH POLITICIAN WITH AUTOCRATIC LEANINGS BUT MAINLY THE SHOW FOLLOWS A FAMILY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE WORLD CHANGING AROUND THEM
POD1000000038_S0000007 RUSSELL T DAVIES CREATED AND WROTE YEARS AND YEARS HE'S ALSO WORKED ON THE SHOW'S DOCTOR WHO TORCHWOOD AND CREATED QUEER AS FOLK
POD1000000038_S0000008 HE SAID THE TECH IN YEARS AND YEARS IS LIKE LIFE IT'S COMPLICATED
POD1000000038_S0000010 SHOW GOOD AND BAD I THINK SOME OF THE SADDEST MOMENTS IT'S YOU HAVE A WORLD WAR BEING ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION AND THE LITTLE FIVE SIX YEAR OLD KIDS JUST SIT STARING INTO THEIR PHONES PLAYING THEIR GAMES
POD1000000038_S0000011 SO YES THERE'S BAD STUFF BUT THAT'S VERY EASY TO TALK ABOUT AND YET THERE'S VERY VERY GOOD STUFF I TELL YOU IT'S LIE WHEN I MADE THE CHOICE TO SEND TO THIS AROUND A FAMILY
POD1000000038_S0000012 THAT CAME FROM ONE OF THE GOOD SIDES OF CURRENT TECH WHICH IS VERY SIMPLY THE WHATSAPP GROUP I'M ONE OF THREE KIDS HAS TWO SISTERS THEY'VE GOT TWO KIDS EACH OR A NICE FAMILY WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER WE GET ON
POD1000000038_S0000013 BUT UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO MY NIECE'S ARE GROWN UP TO THREE YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE TEXTED THEM TWICE A YEAR HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND MERRY CHRISTMAS NOW OH MY GOD I WENT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT AND I CAME BACK TO THE WHATSAPP GROUP 253 MESSAGE
POD1000000038_S0000015 BECAUSE SOMEONE AT COOKED A LASAGNA WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH SO YES THIS GOOD STUFF IF YOU CHOOSE EITHER GOOD OR EITHER BAD YOU'RE NOT BE GOOD RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO GET BOTH IN THERE BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY IT'S IT'S THE
POD1000000038_S0000016 WELL IT'S GREAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE TECH FEELS REALLY IMMEDIATE LIKE A HEADBAND THAT PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC SORT OF SNAPCHAT FILTER FOR YOUR FACE THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD IT'S FUTURISTIC BUT IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY REALISTIC
POD1000000038_S0000017 YES YES I THINK IF THAT WAS INVENTED TOMORROW WE'D ALL GO AND BUY ONE I MEAN I FIND THOSE FILTERS
POD1000000038_S0000019 SENDS EACH OTHER'S PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES LOOKING LIKE A DOG
POD1000000038_S0000021 RASH OF INSTAGRAM FILTERS LIKE WHAT DOG ARE YOU OR WHAT CAKE ARE YOU I'M CERTAINLY A BATTENBURG BUT I LOVE THOSE FILTERS AND I'M FASCINATED BY THE WAY WE LOVE THOSE FILTERS
POD1000000038_S0000022 AND SO THE MOMENT SOMEONE INVENTS A FILTER YOU CAN SEE IN THE REAL WORLD NOT JUST ON YOUR PHONE OH MY GOD I WOULD BE PHONING YOU FROM MY PALACE ON THE MOON
POD1000000038_S0000023 DO YOU HAVE CONFLICTING YOU NO FEELINGS ABOUT TECH OR IS IT LIKE SO MANY THINGS WHERE IT JUST REFLECTS THE REAL WORLD
POD1000000038_S0000024 YEAH IT'S INTERESTING THAT I THINK IT'S BOTH I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINING BUT INTERESTING DOESN'T MEAN BEING GLIB OR DAFT I THINK I'M GETTING OLDER I THINK MY STUFF IS FULL OF WARNINGS NOW TO BE HONEST IT'S FUNNY I'M NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IDIOT MY NEXT DRAMA
POD1000000038_S0000026 HBO MAX OVER THERE WHICH IS ABOUT THE AIDS CRISIS OF THE 1980S
POD1000000038_S0000028 I HAVE JUST WATCHED AN EDIT OF AN EPISODE WARNING ABOUT VIRUSES AND WE STEP OUT OF OUR FRONT DOORS AND THERE'S A VIRUS ON THE LOOSE ITS YOU CAN'T LEARN THOSE LESSONS FROM HISTORY ENOUGH STRANGERS NOW WHAT A WORLD
POD1000000038_S0000029 I WAS TELLING PEOPLE THAT I'M TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT IN A DARKER TIMELINE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME RIGHT LIKE YOU FAST FORWARD IN THESE EPISODES AND INCREASINGLY TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN BUT ALSO
POD1000000038_S0000030 PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING THEIR NORMAL LIVES TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE
POD1000000038_S0000031 YES THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT WAS QUITE A HARD SHOW TO SELL IN HIS SLEEP WITH ITS CONCEPT OF MOVING FORWARD IN TIME AND EVERY EPISODE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR BUT ACTUALLY I SAT THERE SAYING

POD1000000038_S0000035 YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR AND EVERY EPISODE DOWNTON ABBEY
POD1000000038_S0000036 ASSORTED UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS MANY YEARS AGO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT ADD FORM OF DRAMA I'VE INVENTED A SIMPLE EVENT THIS DRUMS GOING TO THE FUTURE EVERYBODY A YEAR EVERY EPISODE THAT HAD PEOPLE SCARED BUT IN TERMS OF DRAMA TERMS OF HOW THE CHARACTERS ARE GETTING ON WHO LOVES WHO
POD1000000038_S0000037 WHO'S GOING OUT WITH WHO WHO'S CROSSED WITH WHO WHO LOVES WHO TO TAKE YEARLY JUMPS IN THAT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DRAMATIC DEVICE SO UM
POD1000000038_S0000038 I KNEW THAT WOULD WORK I HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE THOSE FOUR BEARS TO SAY THIS WILL WORK AND
POD1000000038_S0000039 IT WAS TO GET THAT SORT OF CREEP INTO THE STORY WHICH WE
POD1000000038_S0000041 IN IN SOCIETIES WHEN DICTATORS ARISE OR WHERE HUGE CHANGES ARE MADE AND AND WHERE SOCIETY MIGHT SWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT OR RIGHT TO LEFT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT THAT'S WHY I WANT IT
POD1000000038_S0000042 WHAT ENDS UP SUCH A 15 YEAR SPAN ON THE SHOW IS JUST SOCIALLY THESE THINGS SLOWLY CREEPING UP ON YOU AN EDGE YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH HAVING A TEA OR FALLING IN LOVE

POD1000000038_S0000045 IN THE SHOW OR IS THAT JUST ONE OF THE MANY SORT OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000038_S0000046 IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT COMES UP IN EPISODE 6 AS A IT'S A MEANS OF ISOLATING PEOPLE WITHIN THE STORY TO BE HONEST NOW I'M SEEING A VIRUS LIKE THIS IN ACTION
POD1000000038_S0000047 IT WOULD HAVE DOMINATED EPISODE 6 TOO MUCH ACTUALLY IT'S AMAZING HOW IT DOMINATES OUR EVERY CONVERSATION NOW AND EPISODE 6 AS A DRAMA NOT NOT AS A DOCUMENT OF THE REAL WORLD BUT AS A DRAMA HAS STORIES TO RAP
POD1000000038_S0000049 WE NEED TO KNOW
POD1000000038_S0000050 WITH A LOVERS WILL BE REUNITED WITH THE MARRIAGES WILL STAY TOGETHER SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING NOW THAT I SORT OF THINK THAT I MEAN I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO VIRUSES AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SO I KIND OF YOU KNOW I KNEW I KNEW THAT IT WAS JUST BETWEEN ENDEMIC SAND PANDEMIC

POD1000000047_S0000000 WELCOME TO THE 80,000 HOURS PODCAST THIS INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SPIEGEL HOLDER IS A BIT UNUSUAL IN THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED TWO YEARS AGO
POD1000000047_S0000002 WE WERE CONSIDERING STARTING A PODCAST BACK THEN AND I RECORDED THIS TRIAL EPISODE WITH MY COLLEAGUE JESS WOULD HAVE STONE BUT ULTIMATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT BUT I THOUGHT WHY NOT DIG IT UP AND RELEASE IT NOW
POD1000000047_S0000004 DAVID SPIEGEL HOLDER IS A STATISTICIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING OF AN ACADEMIC CELEBRITY IN THE UK
POD1000000047_S0000006 PART OF HIS ROLE IS TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK ESPECIALLY EVERYDAY RISKS WE FACE LIKE GETTING CANCER OR DYING IN A CAR CRASH AS A RESULT HE'S REGULARLY IN THE MEDIA EXPLAINING THE NUMBERS IN THE NEWS
POD1000000047_S0000007 TRYING TO ASSIST BOTH ORDINARY PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS TO FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT RISKS THAT CONFRONT US AND AVOID BEING DISTRACTED BY A FLASHY RISKS THAT PERHAPS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MUCH IMPACT
POD1000000047_S0000009 TO HELP MAKE SENSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES WE FACE IN LIFE HE'S HAD TO INVENT CONCEPTS LIKE THE MICROLIFE OR A 30 MINUTE CHANGE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY
POD1000000047_S0000011 WE GAVE HIM A CALL BECAUSE HE WANTED TO LEARN WHETHER HE THOUGHT A LIFETIME OF WORK HAD ACTUALLY MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD ENJOY
POD1000000047_S0000013 HERE AT THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING WAYS TO COMPARE WHAT IT MEANS TO DO GOOD AND TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAYS OF DOING GOOD DO THE MOST GOOD SO WE ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH CHARITY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO IF YOU WANT TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
POD1000000047_S0000014 WHAT CAREER SHOULD YOU FOLLOW IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE WORLD AND WHICH CAUSED AREAS HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET CLEAR SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
POD1000000047_S0000016 HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR DAVID SPIEGEL HALTER THE WINTON PROFESSOR FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SPIEGEL HALTER SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS SCIENCE AND RISK IN ORDINARY
POD1000000047_S0000018 REGULARLY APPEARS IN THE UK MEDIA AND RIGHTS ON HIS BLOG UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY DAVID
POD1000000047_S0000019 HI
POD1000000047_S0000021 SO WE'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WE'LL SEE HOW FAR WE GET BUT FIRST TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR POSITION
POD1000000047_S0000022 YEAH I'VE GOT A STRANGE JOB REALLY I MEAN THE MATHS DEPARTMENT AT CAMBRIDGE AND I TEACH STATISTICS TO THE UNDERGRADUATES BUT I'M ACTUALLY FUNDED BY A HEDGE FUND WINTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN HAVEN'T DYED MY CHAIR IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
POD1000000047_S0000023 THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS AND RISK AND SO WHAT I HAVE DONE SINCE I'VE HAD THAT JOB THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IS I SUPPOSED TO TRY TO JOIN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
POD1000000047_S0000024 TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WAY NUMBERS IN PARTICULAR ARE DISCUSSED IN
POD1000000047_S0000026 SO WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS DO YOUR RESEARCH AND WHAT OUTREACH DO TO HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AND UNCERTAINTY BETTER
POD1000000047_S0000027 WELL I GET ASKED TO DO A HUGE AMOUNT OF STUFF AS ALWAYS HELPING IN VARIOUS AGENCIES COMMUNICATING RISK ABOUT THE SORT OF CANCER RISK BY THE RISK OF DRUG SCREENING FOR EXAMPLE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF SCREENING I WOULD MY BACKGROUND IS IN MEDICAL STATISTICS
POD1000000047_S0000028 SO THAT'S WHAT I GET TO DO QUITE A LOT BUT I'VE DONE TV PROGRAMS BY CLIMATE CHANGE OR DONE RADIO STUFF ABOUT YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THREATS TO SOCIETY FUKUSHIMA 2 AND SO ON
POD1000000047_S0000029 AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT THREATS TO US INDIVIDUALLY AND AND WHAT WE MIGHT HOW WE MIGHT GO TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THOSE SO
POD1000000047_S0000030 I'M VERY INTERESTED IN RELEVANCE OF THE GREAT GLOBAL EXISTENTIAL RISKS ARE MORE INTERESTING THINGS THAT AFFECT US ALL INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT HOW WE EAT OUR EXERCISE TRANSFORMS AND SO
POD1000000047_S0000032 SO YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND REALLY INTERESTING IN THIS AREA IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE VERY POOR ESTIMATING LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES AND SURRENDER
POD1000000047_S0000033 OVERESTIMATING THE SCALE OF SOME PROBLEMS OR RISKS THAT THEY FACE AND UNDER ESTIMATING OTHERS FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE MOST PRONE TO OVERESTIMATE OR UNDERESTIMATE AND GET WRONG IN VERY HARMFUL WAYS
POD1000000047_S0000034 WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS BY PSYCHOLOGIST AS YOU KNOW AND AND OF COURSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE I ALWAYS INCLUDE MYSELF IN THIS
POD1000000047_S0000035 YOU KNOW I'M AS SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF MY EMOTIONAL GUT REACTIONS AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE I'M NOT MAKING ANY CLAIM ABOUT SOME SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND RATIONALITY COMPARED WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE
POD1000000047_S0000036 WE JUST KNOW THAT THE WAY WE RESPOND TO THINGS ARE VERY TO SIMPLIFY WALK YOU KNOW WE CAN THINK IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN RESPOND TO THAT GUTS OR WE CAN TRY TO ENGAGE OUR BRAIN AND THINK SLOWLY ABOUT
POD1000000047_S0000037 I'M DONE AND THIS IS SO RELEVANT WHEN IT COMES TO RISK PARTICULARLY THIS IDEA THAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US IS AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC IS VERY STRONG
POD1000000047_S0000038 WHAT WE HEAR IN THE NEWS WE HEAR ABOUT EBOLA WE HEAR ABOUT TERRORISM WE HEAR ABOUT THE LATEST THREATS THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE SHOULD WAY WE TRAVEL AND WE GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHEN THERE'S A PLANE CRASH OR WHATEVER
POD1000000047_S0000039 AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE NEWS THAT'S WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US IN THIS WHAT'S WHAT SO PROMINENT BUT OF COURSE SO MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMALL INDEED THIS IS NOT A THREAT TO US PARTICULARLY AT ALL
POD1000000047_S0000040 AND THE THINGS THAT ARE MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WE DON'T HEAR MUCH OF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE JUST IN HER HEART DISEASE CANCER ALL THIS OTHER STUFF THAT WE HAD GET A LARGER AMOUNT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LACK OF EXERCISE OR CRUMB DIET
POD1000000047_S0000041 SO ON THE COURSE IS PEOPLE GET A BIT BORED WITH THAT BECAUSE AND DON'T GET SO CONCERNED ABOUT
POD1000000047_S0000042 DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE HAD ANY SUCCESS IMPROVING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS AND GETTING PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE STUFF THAT REALLY MATTERS
POD1000000047_S0000043 OH I DON'T KNOW IT'S GREAT PLEASURE I MEAN IT'D BE GREAT TO THINK SO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED SOME GOOD PROJECTS SO THAT ME VERY PROUD OF FOR EXAMPLE THE REDESIGN OF THE CANCER SCREENING LEAFLETS IN THE UK WHICH PRESENT THE BENEFITS AND RISKS
POD1000000047_S0000044 CANCER SCREENING IN A VERY BALANCED WAY THEY HUGELY INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE IS IN THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE GO FOR SCREENING THEY JUST SAY WELL THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS
POD1000000047_S0000045 THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE HARMS MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT COMMUNICATING RISK IS NOT SO LOW YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT WATCH OUT THIS IS TERRIBLE SAY WELL IF YOU DO THIS THIS MIGHT HAPPEN OR IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN
POD1000000047_S0000046 AND WEIGH IT UP AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR SOME INTELLIGENT WHICH I THINK PEOPLE BASICALLY ARE BOTH OF PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID BUT I AM PROUD OF IS BEING PART OF A GENERAL COMMUNITY THAT'S VERY STRONG IN BRITAIN TO DO WITH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENCE
POD1000000047_S0000047 AND
POD1000000047_S0000049 WHICH IS I'M JUST A SMALL PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT COVERS THE MATERIAL ON THE RADIO STUFF ON TELEVISION STUFF IN IN SOME NEWSPAPERS AND IN VARIOUS AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATISTICS OF THOR
POD1000000047_S0000050 WHICH IS JUST TRYING TO TAKE A MUCH MORE CRITICAL ATTITUDE TO THE WAY THE NUMBERS AND EVIDENCE ARE USED IN SOCIETY AND I THINK IT WORKS IN BRITAIN WHERE ARE THE GOOD COMPARED WITH MOST PEOPLE ABOUT
POD1000000047_S0000052 WE DON'T HAVE THESE IN MASSIVE FEARS OF VACCINATIONS OF NUCLEAR POWER OF EVEN GMOS AND AND SO I THINK THIS IS A SIGN THAT WE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE DEVELOPED QUITE A GOOD PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE
POD1000000047_S0000054 I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL YOU THINK THERE IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE AN IMPACT AT THEIR CAREER GOING INTO A CAREER PATH SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN AND TRYING TO GET INTO PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO
POD1000000047_S0000055 TO HAVE A BROADER IMPACT RATHER THAN NECESSARILY JUST DOING RESEARCH AND ACADEMIA SO HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT IS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING AND IS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WISH MORE ACADEMICS DID WORK ON
POD1000000047_S0000056 ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I'VE REALLY COME TO IT QUITE LATE AS IT HAS A REAL PART OF MY CAREER AS I SAID AGAIN BECAUSE PHILANTHROPIST IN A HEDGE FUND YOU KNOW PROVIDED THE FUNDING FOR THE GL TO DO THIS FULL TIME
POD1000000047_S0000057 BUT I WAS DOING SOME BEFORE AS PART OF MY JOB AND I INCREASINGLY FEEL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A DUTY OF ACADEMICS AFTER ALL THE PUBLICLY FUNDED FOR A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEM TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME ON PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY
POD1000000047_S0000058 NOT REALLY WE'RE GOING TO SOLO THOUGH I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A WEBSITE EXPLAINING WHAT THEY DO AND AND THAT THIS SHOULD BE IS ALSO SUPPORTED AND IT SHOULD BE INCENTIVES WITHIN THE CAREER STRUCTURE FOR ACADEMICS TO DO
POD1000000047_S0000059 NOT QUITE PLEASED THAT IN CAMBRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PROMOTION OF PEOPLE THEIR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT OH I STRONGLY SUPPORT SO IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY BUT I THINK IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT IN GRAPHIC IMAGE TO DO
POD1000000047_S0000060 I'M ALSO DOING THEIR WORK ALMOST IN WHATEVER AREA IT HAS A RELEVANCE TO SOCIETY AND IT CAN POTENTIALLY
POD1000000047_S0000062 IMPROVE SOCIETY AND THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON
POD1000000047_S0000063 I PERSONALLY THINK THE STATISTICS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETY AND ADAMS VERY STRONGLY ON MANY STATISTICIANS DO AND IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
POD1000000047_S0000064 THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY HAS NOW GOT AN INITIATIVE OF WE TRAINING UP STATISTICS AMBASSADOR'S YOUNG STATISTICIANS WHO WANT TO DO THIS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND COMMUNICATE THE IMPORTANCE THEY WORK AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE WITH WEEK NUMBERS AND
POD1000000047_S0000065 I THINK THIS IS SO EXCITING SUCH
POD1000000047_S0000067 SO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WE MEET THINKING OF GOING INTO ACADEMIA DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT IN THE WORLD OF COURSE THERE ARE ALSO SOME DRAWBACKS THAT YOU MIGHT BE AWARE OF FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN ACADEMIA
POD1000000047_S0000068 YES YEAH I'M NOT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY YOU KNOW TO RECOMMEND YES YOU SHOULD REALLY SHOULD GO INTO ACADEMIA YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY AND FRANKLY THE PEOPLE THAT I STARTED IT'S QUITE REALIZE IT'S VERY TOUGH NOW
POD1000000047_S0000069 THIS IS MOVING MOST KOREANS WHO SEEM TO BE A LOT MORE PRESSURES ON THEM THEY USED TO BE SO IT'S QUITE CAN BE QUITE A TOUGH CALL I THINK BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF GOOD STUFF PEOPLE WORK THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH AND KNOW IN OTHER AREAS WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING HIM
POD1000000047_S0000070 NATURAL NATURAL NATURAL THREATS NATURAL DISASTERS WHEN WERE WORKING IN BOTANY WILL WORK IN ANY AREA AND PLANT SCIENCES WHATEVER ARE REALLY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO IMPROVE
POD1000000047_S0000071 A LOT OF THE WORLD AND I'M SO IMPRESSED BY THEIR DEDICATION BUT IT IS A TOUGH JOB AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IN THIS SORT OF PUSH TO GOT TO PUBLISH THE WORK YOU'VE GOT TO DO ALL THIS GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS
POD1000000047_S0000073 WELL THIS BUSINESS IN ORDER TO BUILD ONE'S CAREER IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPEAR FIRST THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING GREAT GOOD IN WHAT YOU DO VERY LITTLE OF IT YOU CAN SEE A DIRECT IMPACT HOWEVER AS I KNOW THAT AND WHAT'S PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT IS THAT IT
POD1000000047_S0000074 IT IS BUILDING A LOT OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT YOU CAN USE AND I FIND THAT IN MY STATISTICAL SKILLS FOR EXAMPLE ARE IN MASSIVE DEMAND AND BY ALL SORTS OF AGENCIES AND I COULD POINT IN PARTICULAR TO THE
POD1000000047_S0000075 PULL THIS UP AND LYNNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE AND SUSTAINABLE PLANT THE GOALS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE AROUND
POD1000000047_S0000076 WHICHEVER PLACING THEM IN WHICH THE SORT OF MONITORING OF THE STATE OF WELFARE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND JUST BEING ABLE TO MEASURE THINGS AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND
POD1000000047_S0000077 TO DEVELOP GOOD WAYS TO DO SURVEYS TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT WORKS AND HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE THESE MEASURES IS HAS BECOME NORMS DEVICE OR NORMAL IMPORTANT SO I THINK WELL AGAIN I COMING BACK TO THE FACT THAT I THINK STATISTICS IS
POD1000000047_S0000078 PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AREA TO GO INTO
POD1000000047_S0000080 YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY THE KEY IDEA BEHIND A FACTOR OUT TOURISM IS THAT WE WANT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ALTRUISTIC ACTIVITIES WHICH CHARITIES WHICH CAREER PATHS WHICH CAUSES DO THE MOST GOOD AND WE THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO
POD1000000047_S0000081 MEASURE THINGS OR AT LEAST TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE IN MAKING PROGRESS ON THOSE QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER SO A COMMON CRITICISM THAT WE OFTEN GET IS PEOPLE SAYING SOMETHING LIKE
POD1000000047_S0000082 OH IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CHARITIES OR CAREERS DO THE MOST GOOD SO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TOUGH TRYING AND YOU SHOULD JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT OR YOU KNOW HELP PERSONAL CAUSES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS KIND OF OBJECTION AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO IT
POD1000000047_S0000083 IN A CONCERN ABOUT THERE BEING TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW WE OFTEN RESPOND BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRY AND ESTIMATING IS CLEARLY THE BEST WE HAVE BUT YEAH WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS CHALLENGE AND
POD1000000047_S0000085 I MEAN THIS IS NOT A COMMENT THAT'S JUST RESTRICTED TO WHAT IT TO THE AREA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME USED TO HAPPEN IN HEALTH CARE IF YOU SAY OH YOU CAN'T PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN LIFE
POD1000000047_S0000086 AND WE JUST GOT TO DO ALL WE CAN TO DO GOOD IF WE HAVE TO JUST GO WITH OUR GUTS ESSENTIALLY NO THIS THAT VIEW NOW CERTAIN UK IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY DISCREDITED YOU CAN PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN BUT WE DO ALL THE TIME
POD1000000047_S0000087 BUT SURE EVERYONE WOULD AGREE BUT
POD1000000047_S0000088 NOT FOR EVERYONE YOU CAN AGREE AND IT COOLS
POD1000000047_S0000089 YOU HAVE TO
POD1000000047_S0000090 BUT NICE FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER A DECADE
POD1000000047_S0000092 PUTTING A VALUE ON THE MARGINAL BENEFIT OF A PARTICULAR HEALTH CARE INTERVENTION AND ASSESSING WHAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE ACCORDING TO THESE FORMAL CRITERIA AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT PERFECT WE KNOW THIS DOES NOT MEASURE EVERYTHING
POD1000000047_S0000093 BUT IT'S EXPLICIT WAS TRANSPARENT AND THEY'VE DONE THEIR BEST ON THAT SITE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SUCCESS IN A HUGE EXAMPLE TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOU NOW WE KNOW IT'S AN IT'S NEVER PERFECT IS NEVER PERFECT
POD1000000047_S0000094 BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE THEN TRIED TO TAKE THAT APPROACH WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL AND HEALTHY AND MOVE IT INTO OTHER AREAS NOW HOW CAN YOU DO IT SO PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN YOUR HAG WE MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE
POD1000000047_S0000095 HOW ABOUT WHAT THE TREES WERE STILL HAS QUITE A LOT
POD1000000047_S0000097 WORK OUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT TERRAINS MEASURE THE BENEFIT OF A HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT SECTOR WITH THE VALUE OF SPECIES WAS THAT
POD1000000047_S0000098 I MEAN IT SEEMS IT IS TOO EASY TO SIT BACK SO YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU CAN'T MEASURE THAT WELL YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD GO HAVE A GOAT GO SO AS WE SAY IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN TRYING YOUR BEST REALIZING YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT
POD1000000047_S0000099 BUT NOT TO BE PUT OFF HAVING A GOOD GO SO IT'S LIKE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO IN STATISTICS TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS TRYING TO MODEL THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT WE DO IS INADEQUATE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T DO USEFUL THINGS
POD1000000047_S0000101 CAN YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT NICE AND HOW THEY PRIORITIZE HEALTH TREATMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM
POD1000000047_S0000102 YEAH I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE WORKED ON A MEDICAL STATISTICIAN I'VE BEEN A HUGE SUPPORTER OF NICE AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER DECIDE WHEN HAVE A NEW VACCINE OR WHETHER TO SIDE HAVING NEW RECOMMEND
POD1000000047_S0000103 FOR DRUGS TO BE PAID FOR UNDER THE NHS EXAMPLE THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THAT OF THAT INTERVENTION AND WHAT'S THE EXPECTED COST AND THE NEW LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST TO
POD1000000047_S0000104 AND PROVIDE AN EXTRA ONE THEY CALL IT QUALITY A QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS OR ONE YEAR OF LIFE THAT'S DISCOUNTED IF IT'S POOR QUALITY YOU WILL NEW DISCOUNT IT WON'T BE WORTH THE WHOLE YEAR AND THEN ESSENTIALLY THEY CAN MAKE A COMPARISON
POD1000000047_S0000105 AND THEY LOOK IF SOMETHING COMES IN AT LESS THAN 20,000 POUNDS OF QUALITY JUST WARMS IS PAID FOR JUST YEP FINE WE'LL PAY FOR IT UNDER THE NHS IF IT'S MORE THAN ABOUT 30,000 THEN THEY REALLY TRY
POD1000000047_S0000107 WE DON'T WANT TO PLAY FOR
POD1000000047_S0000108 I'M TRY TO GO BACK TO THE DRUG COMPANY TO RENEGOTIATE A PRICE EXAMPLE BETWEEN 20,000 AND 30,000 WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S MORE IN THE GREY ZONE SO AND THIS HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY BENEFICIAL PARTLY
POD1000000047_S0000109 IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO DRUG COMPANIES AND GET INTRODUCED THEIR CRISIS BUT AND ALSO TO SEE THAT SOME INTERVENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE CANCER SCREENING COMING EXTREMELY CHEAP THEY JUST WORTH DOING IT ALSO MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE EXPLICIT FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THE FUTURE
POD1000000047_S0000110 RATHER THAN THE PRESENT BECAUSE THEY PUT IN A DISCOUNT RIGHT CAN BE THREE MILES DESCENT AND NOW THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW YEAR OF LIFE IN 25 YEARS TIME FOR EXAMS ONLY WORTH ABOUT HALF WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE NOW IS WITH US AND THAT'S TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
POD1000000047_S0000111 I KNOW THAT CAUSE IT'S CONTROVERSIAL AND IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BIG POLICY DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S FAR TOO BIG A DISCOUNT RATE WE WOULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE WORLD IN A HUNDRED YEARS TIME IF WE USE THAT DISCOUNT RATE SO IN DIFFERENT AREAS
POD1000000047_S0000112 YOU MIGHT BE WANTING TO USE A DIFFERENT DISC THIS CAMERA BUT THESE ARE TAKING ECONOMIC IDEAS AND MOVING THEM INTO VERY HUMAN DECISIONS
POD1000000047_S0000113 AND I THINK THEY ARE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL AND ILLUMINATING BUT THEY'RE NEVER PERFECT
POD1000000047_S0000115 YEAH I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN AN ARTICLE WITH PROFESSOR TO BE ORDERED ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT HEALTH EVEN THOUGH WE SHOULD DISCOUNT FINANCIAL RETURNS THAT WHY WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE IN ONE CASE AND NOT IN THE OTHER SO WE'LL PUT UP A LINK TO THAT ON THE WEBSITE SO
POD1000000047_S0000116 A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING OUT THEIR CAREERS THEY FEEL JUST OVERWHELMED BY UNCERTAINTY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO EARN IN ONE CAREER OR WHAT'S THE CHANCES OF GETTING INTO ACADEMIA OR BEING ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT
POD1000000047_S0000117 HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN THEY'RE JUST SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY
POD1000000047_S0000118 WELL I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO BUY THIS AGAIN THIS IS COMMON TO EVERYTHING WE DO WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FUTURE WHICH IS GREAT PEOPLE DON'T DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT THEY'RE GOING TO GET FOR CHRISTMAS LET ALONE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO US THEIR LIVES
POD1000000047_S0000119 AND SO THIS IS JUST A COMMON PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH WHAT WE MICHAEL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY RISK IS WHEN IT'S A VERY WELL DEFINED PROBLEM IS SHORT TERM ISSUES AND BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES ARE
POD1000000047_S0000120 THEN WE CAN SORT OF LIKE A RATIONAL APPROACH WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH DEEPER UNCERTAINTY WHEN REALLY I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE WHAT MIGHT HOW OUR LIVES MIGHT DEVELOP THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE A COMPLETE INFORMAL APPROACH AND SO I WOULD
POD1000000047_S0000121 TRY TO SAY OH WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS MATHEMATICALLY AT ALL HOWEVER THE BASICS OF THOSE QUALITATIVE IDEAS OF THINKING THROUGH RATIONAL DECISION A STILL VERY VALUABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK OF YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE
POD1000000047_S0000122 ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT I MIGHT DO NOW THERE'S ALWAYS AN ADEQUATE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO THINK OF EVERYTHING AND HOWEVER BY THINKING THROUGH THAT SOME THINGS MIGHT COME TO BECOME A MEDIA PARENTS WHOM IMMEDIATE RANKING
POD1000000047_S0000123 WHAT IS PREFERABLE I'M NOT CAREFUL I MIGHT BECOME A POUND AND AND OTHERWISE AND YOU CAN WILL MIGHT NEED TO FALL BACK AND THINK ON ON BROADER STRATEGIES FOR MAKING DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF
POD1000000047_S0000124 WHAT WE CALLED DEEPER UNCERTAINTY THIS IS DEEPLY CONTESTED AREA AND WHEN GOVERNMENTS MAKE POLICIES VERY OFTEN THEY'RE IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY CAN'T EVEN THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AND SO THEIR THEIR HAND IN THE SITUATION DEEP UNCERTAINTY
POD1000000047_S0000125 AND PEOPLE SUGGESTED VARIOUS WAYS TO GO BACK TO THE FIRST THING IS TO NOT TO THINK THAT YOU CAN OPTIMIZE YOU CAN'T BE PERFECT YOU CANNOT BE PERFECT SO THAT SORT OF SUGGESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE IN TERMS OF GENERAL DECISION MAKING THESE
POD1000000047_S0000126 TO DO WITH FLEXIBILITY AND RESILIENCE THAT YOU WANT TO BE YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN DO YOU WANT TO BUILD IN FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTIVE Z2 YOUR DECISION
POD1000000047_S0000127 THAT'S THE SAME WAY YOUR BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT ANY NEW PROJECT AT ALL THE OTHER THING IS TO BUILD IN RESILIENCE IN WHICH YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY CAN COPE WITH THE UNEXPECTED THINGS AND THAT MEANS BOTH AND YOU KNOW THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY GOOD THINGS
POD1000000047_S0000128 AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY BAD WORDS YOU ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVEN'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET ESSENTIALLY SO YOU THINK SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU HAVE A COMPLETELY GONE UP A TOTAL BLIND ALLEY THAT YOU CAN'T RENEGOTIATE
POD1000000047_S0000129 WHICH MEANS OPERATING FROM THE BASIS MOST ROBUST BASIS AS POSSIBLE SO IT MEANS NOT TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THE SINGLE PATH BUT BUILDING IN ROBUSTNESS WHICH MEANS NOT ONLY I THINK IN TERMS OF CAREER COURSE BUILDING IN
POD1000000047_S0000130 TRANSFERABLE SKILLS YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO I THINK THESE ARE STANDARD TACTICS FOR RESPONDING TO DUPER UNCERTAINTY AND WHICH CAN BE USED IN ANY SITUATION
POD1000000047_S0000132 YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THE ORGANIZATION 80,000 HOURS WHO ADVISE PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT WITH THEIR CREWS REALLY FOCUS ON IS ESPECIALLY EARLY IN YOUR CAREER LIKE KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN TO THINGS THAT ARE ROBUST UNDER YOU KNOW LOTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE THINGS HAPPEN
POD1000000047_S0000134 WHAT ARE THE QUESTION THAT WE FIND WE COME UP AGAINST A FAIR AMOUNT AND THINKING ABOUT CAREERS AND CHARITIES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS IS YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT CHOOSING BETWEEN A SMALL CHANCE OF SOME REALLY HUGE OUTCOME LIKE YOU KNOW SAVING THE WORLD FROM A PANDEMIC THAT JUST KILLS MILLIONS
POD1000000047_S0000136 AGAINST SOME HIGH PROBABILITY OF A VERY MODERATE OR A MORE MODERATE OUTCOMES YOU KNOW HELPING PEOPLE IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DEAL WITH DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW PEOPLE CAN GO ABOUT MAKING THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS
POD1000000047_S0000137 YOU'RE VERY DIFFICULT BUT AGAIN THESE ARE COMMON DECISIONS YOU KNOW ARE ALWAYS IN OUR LIVES DO WE GO FOR THIS OF THE HIGH RISK OPTION OR THE OR THE SAFER OR THE SAFER OPTION AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT
POD1000000047_S0000138 MIXED STRATEGIES IS SOMETHING THAT BUSINESSES I THINK WOULD RECOMMEND ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT WE'RE GOING TO BE I'M NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BUT OFTEN NOTHING PEOPLE WOULD TAKE A AN IDEA OF PORTFOLIO
POD1000000047_S0000139 ALL OF RISK AND CAN CAUSE THESE ARE ALL RISKS EVEN YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING LEAVING TO DO AND HE'S ALL RISKS AND SO THAT YOU MIGHT YOU KNOW HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT INVESTED IN RATHER SAY THINGS FOR THE SAKE RETURNING PRETTY SURE
POD1000000047_S0000140 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT'S GOING TO HAVE A REASONABLE RETURN AND REALLY GET CAN PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY'RE WHAT YOU'RE USING YOUR CAREER YOUR MONEY FOR WHAT YOU'RE GIVING FOR OUR ON THE OTHER HAND ON MORE SPECULATIVE
POD1000000047_S0000141 WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT COME TONIGHT COME TO COME TO ANYTHING EITHER BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IS PROMISING
POD1000000047_S0000142 WELL WORK OR THE THREAT WON'T ARISE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO I THINK YOU'RE MIXED STRATEGY IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN NO WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST PUT ALL THE EGGS IN ONE BASKET
POD1000000047_S0000144 THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE I ALSO PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IS COMPLETELY MY PERSONAL REACTION ABOUT GIVING IS THAT AND I QUITE LIKE A MIXED STRATEGY IN WHICH SOME THINGS ARE THE BIGGER
POD1000000047_S0000146 SWATI ANONYMOUS
POD1000000047_S0000147 TERMS WHERE YOU'LL GIVE HIM
POD1000000047_S0000149 LARGE ORGANIZATIONS DOING SOMETHING WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING IN A PILOT PROBABLY FAIRLY PREDICTABLE WAY TO IMPROVING THINGS FOR PEOPLE VERSUS YOU KNOW THE MORE PERSONAL ONES WHERE YOU DO HAVE THE PURSE
POD1000000047_S0000150 OKAY AND AND YOU MIGHT GET THE SLIGHTLY MORE SORT OF EMOTIONAL FEEDBACK FROM THAT PARTLY BECAUSE THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE ON A MORAL GOOD FEEDBACK FROM THE ALTRUISM MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE ON A BIG RAT
POD1000000047_S0000151 A BIGGER COMMITMENT
POD1000000047_S0000153 SO THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO QUANTIFY THE RISKS OR POSSIBLE GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACTIVITY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A MICRO MORE OR A MICRO LIFE IS
POD1000000047_S0000154 OH YEAH YEAH THESE ARE UNITS THAT WHILE I REINVENTED THE MICROLIFE SOMEONE ELSE INVENTED THE MICRO MORE IS JUST A WAY TRYING TO GET A COMMON SCALE FOR IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OF MICROMETERS ACUTE RISKS THE THINGS THAT MIGHT KILL YOU ON THE SPOT BUT OTHERWISE YOU'RE HEALTHY
POD1000000047_S0000155 AND IT'S A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF DYING BECAUSE OF ACTION MIGHT TAKE SO SKYDIVING OR SOMETHING'S APPROXIMATELY EVEN 710 MIKE REWARDS AND MICRO LIFE WHICH IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHRONIC RISKS WHICH IS THE RISK OF
POD1000000047_S0000156 I THINK WE WILL STOP ON QUITE INTERESTING WHICH IS BAD LIFESTYLE YEAH LACK OF EXERCISE OR SMOKING OR DRINKING OR BAD DIET WHATEVER WHICH ISN'T GOING TO KILL YOU ON THE SPOT AND
POD1000000047_S0000157 WILL SHORTZ IS LIKELY TO SHORTEN THE LIFE DEFINITELY NOT DEFINITELY AT ALL MAYBE NOT BUT PROBABLY WILL AND SO IT'S A REDUCTION OF HALF AN HOUR IN YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY AND I FIND THESE QUITE USEFUL BECAUSE IT ENABLES YOU TO COMPARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT
POD1000000047_S0000158 THINGS LIKE DIET AND SMOKING AND EXERCISE AND THINGS AND MAKES ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY SMOKING IS WHERE YOU GET THE BIGGEST RETURN OR THE BIGGEST NO AND IN TERMS OF NOT SMOKING THAT THE HUGE BIGGEST RETURN AND
POD1000000047_S0000160 DRINKING AT LOW DOSES WELL ACTUALLY DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
POD1000000047_S0000162 HUGE HUGE CONCERNS YOU'RE REALLY SWEATING IT DONE BUT EXERCISE AGAIN I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND DIET IMPORTANT AND AND
POD1000000047_S0000163 IT JUST GIVES YOU A FEELING OF WHAT'S WHERE THE WHERE THE PRIORITIES ARE WHICH OF COURSE IT'S ALL A BIT OBVIOUS THERE THE PRIORITIES THAT PEOPLE DO IN PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT MAKES YOU SLIGHTLY UNCONCERNED ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE REALLY CONCERNED
POD1000000047_S0000165 SO THESE CONCEPTS WERE INVENTED TO HELP PEOPLE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD INVENT A NEW CONCEPTS TO HELP PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN DO MORE GOOD IN THE WORLD
POD1000000047_S0000167 YEAH YOU KNOW A MICRO
POD1000000047_S0000169 IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN THE QUALITY IS A STATE IS A GOOD ONE IF YOU'RE REALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOUR AREA OF CAUSES IS TO DO WITH SAVING LIVES AND IMPROVING HEALTH IN THE LETHAL RISK TO PEOPLE THEN QUALITIES IS A GOOD ONE AND IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW
POD1000000047_S0000171 SO HOW MANY YEARS OF LIFE ARE YOU GOING TO GAIN FOR FROM YOUR INTERVENTION AND WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GIVING MONEY FOR SOME PARTICULAR CHARITIES
POD1000000047_S0000173 PROMOTE
POD1000000047_S0000174 THEY'RE EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE IN THAT WAY
POD1000000047_S0000175 IT'S MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE A BROADER IDEA FOR EXAMPLE OF SUPPORTING EDUCATION THAT'S ON PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON QUITE HOW TO PUT A NUMBER ON THAT WITHIN A WITHIN A PARTICULAR AREA CAUSE
POD1000000047_S0000176 CAUSE THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IT BUT PROMOTE HAVING METRICS THAT
POD1000000047_S0000178 GO RIGHT ACROSS COURT DIFFERENT
POD1000000047_S0000180 IS DIFFICULT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CRITICIZED
POD1000000047_S0000182 ATTEMPT TO DO IT
POD1000000047_S0000183 I STILL THINK IT'S WORTH TRYING TO DO I MEAN AND PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO DO THIS WITH
POD1000000047_S0000185 WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON NOW I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT ANY GREAT IDEA TO BE HONEST AND TO I MEAN ONE POSSIBILITY OF COURSE IS
POD1000000047_S0000186 IS LOOKING AT WHAT GENERAL MEASURES OF WELL BEING IT AGAIN PEOPLE ARE DOING WHICH IS MEASURED BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS NOW TO TRY TO MEASURE WELL BEING IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THEIR ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND
POD1000000047_S0000187 SO GENERAL WELL BEING INDICES WHICH ARE NOT JUST HEALTH RELATED LENGTH OF LIFE RELATED AND I THINK YOU KNOW GOT HAVE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE PERFECT MEASURE ON ME
POD1000000047_S0000188 SO PEOPLE OFTEN ASK YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU RATE HOW GOOD YOUR LIFE IS GOING FROM 1 TO 10 TYPICALLY THEY GIVE ANSWERS BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT AT LEAST IN THE UK
POD1000000047_S0000189 MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A MICRO HAPPY WHICH WOULD BE SOMETHING AS GOOD AS MOVING SOME RUN FROM 6 TO 7 OR 7 TO 8 ON THIS WELFARE SCALE
POD1000000047_S0000190 YEAH YEAH EXACTLY I THINK THAT THOSE SCALES WELL ACTUALLY I FIND THEM VERY REVEALING WHEN PEOPLE DO MENTION THIS PARTICULAR CROSS CULTURES AS YOU SAID
POD1000000047_S0000192 EVERYONE SAYS SEVEN
POD1000000047_S0000194 BECAUSE I WELCOME SEVEN BUT IT ALSO REFLECTS HAS IDEA WHERE IS NOT BAD YOU KNOW
POD1000000047_S0000195 MUSTN'T GRUMBLE
POD1000000047_S0000197 COULD BE BETTER BUT MUSTN'T GRUMBLE YOU KNOW SO SLIGHTLY BRITISH STOIC ATTITUDE SO GRAHAM I THINK HE'S ALWAYS PREDICTABLE WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RESPOND BUT I FIND FOR EXAMPLE THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESPONSES PEOPLE AND HOW THE AGE DISTRIBUTION VARIES ACROSS CULTURES
POD1000000047_S0000198 EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND THE IDEA OF WHETHER ONE COULD MOVE
POD1000000047_S0000200 GROUPS OF PEOPLE ON THAT SCALE AND WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT WHEN I THINK OF IS SORT OF CHARITIES AND SOME OF THE ONES I GO I GET TO WITH YOU KNOW
POD1000000047_S0000201 NOT DIRECTLY I DON'T THINK IT'LL ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER BUT YOU WOULD HOPE TO REALLY IMPROVE PEOPLE'S WELL BEING AND SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND YOU CONSIDER THEM
POD1000000047_S0000202 YEAH IT IS A FASCINATING AREA OF RESEARCH AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES SO I THINK IN THE UK AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA PEOPLE DO TEND TO GIVE SEVEN OR MAYBE EIGHT IF THEY'RE FEELING PARTICULARLY GOOD BUT IN SOUTH AMERICA PEOPLE ARE JUST FOR SOME REASON MORE EXUBERANT
POD1000000047_S0000203 SEND 10 TO OFTEN GIVE EIGHT EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RELATIVELY POOR BY CONTRAST IN EASTERN EUROPE AND EASTERN ASIA LIKE JAPAN AND CHINA IT WOULD TEND TO HAVE RELATIVELY LOW SCORES RELATIVE TO HOW LAUGHS THERE WHILE SEEMS TO THEIR LIFE SEEMS TO BE GOING FROM THE OUTSIDE
POD1000000047_S0000204 YEAH YEAH YEAH NO NO PEOPLE NEED DIFFERENT COLORS I THINK IN AFRICA THERE EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD BE VERY
POD1000000047_S0000206 YEAH THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES THAT WHERE THE AVERAGE IS AS LOW AS A FOUR OUT OF TEN WHICH MAYBE HALF OF PEOPLE ARE GIVING LESS THAN 4 WHICH IS A BIT UNFORTUNATE
POD1000000047_S0000207 BUT IT CAN BE I MEAN THESE ARE I VERY CULTURALLY I THINK SPECIFIC AND SO BUT I THINK ONE WOULD SEE IS RELATIVE CHANGES RELATIVE CHANGES CAPS ARE YOU KNOW COMPARED WITH
POD1000000047_S0000208 THE AVERAGE IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT ONE FOR THAT YOU CAN'T JUST LET EVERYONE GET EVERYONE UP TO 8 OR WHATEVER THEY MEAN THERE ARE DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT CULTURAL ATTITUDES TO DO WITH I THINK THAT WE ARE REFLECTED IN THOSE QUESTIONS
POD1000000047_S0000209 YEAH SO BY TRYING TO ESTIMATE RISKS OR THE SIZE OF PROBLEMS IN THIS QUANTITATIVE WAY DO YOU THINK WE RISK BEING BIASED AGAINST APPROACHES THAT ARE HARDER TO QUANTIFY
POD1000000047_S0000210 YEAH IT IS A PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING THE THE MODEL THE MEASURE WHICH IS ONLY IN A VERY INADEQUATE THING STARTS TRYING IT STARTS BECOMING THE THING THAT YOU ARE IN FACT BEEN TRYING TO YOU KNOW YOU FOCUS ON
POD1000000047_S0000211 TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALL OTHERS I MEAN AND THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH OVER YOU KNOW MET RESIZING ANY ACTIVITY PRETENDING THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE BENEFITS OF
POD1000000047_S0000213 ACADEMIC WORLD THIS IS A HAND
POD1000000047_S0000214 REAL EXAMPLE THAT WHEN PEOPLE STOP GETTING OBSESSED WITH IMPACT FACTORS AND NONSENSE LIKE THAT SO THERE'S THERE'S A REAL DANGER WITH BELIEVING THESE THINGS TOO MUCH AT THE SAME TIME
POD1000000047_S0000215 YOU SHOULD HAVE A DAMN GOOD GO AT HER DIE TRYING TO DO IT AND JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS DIFFICULT AND CANNOT BE DONE PERFECTLY TO ME DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T AT LEAST HAVE A STAB AT IT COULD BECAUSE YOU
POD1000000047_S0000217 NO OPTION
POD1000000047_S0000218 THESE THINGS YOU MIGHT BE GETTING REALLY CLEAR RANKINGS GREAT PRECISION MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT NOT AN EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES COMPARED WITH INCIDENT
POD1000000047_S0000220 YEAH AND I THINK THAT RATHER THAN GIVING AS A PERFECT ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS USING YOU KNOW MODELS AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT FACTORS CAN AS YOU SAY JUST HELP YOU TO IDENTIFY LIKE CLEAR DIFFERENCES OR AREAS WHERE YOU NEED TO GET MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FACTOR THAT IN
POD1000000047_S0000221 SOMETHING SO IT CAN DEFINITELY BE VERY USEFUL FINALLY JUST TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN BENEFIT FROM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS LEARNING MORE STATISTICS YOU KNOW EITHER IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES OR IN BEING MORE EFFECTIVE AS ALTRUISTIC
POD1000000047_S0000222 UM AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK I GUESS RELATING BACK TO THE PULSE QUESTION IT COULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT US
POD1000000047_S0000224 YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW OF COURSE I DO OF COURSE I'D SAY THIS WOULDN'T MIND AND BUT YEAH I DO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING A GREATER IDEA OF STATS AND MEASUREMENT AND NUMBER AND QUANTITY
POD1000000047_S0000225 AND AND THE FRAILTIES OF THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THE POINT ABOUT UNDERSTANDING STATISTICS IS ABOUT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR WEAKNESSES THEM TO ABSOLUTELY HAND IN HAND WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO DO AT THE MOMENT WE WERE NOT YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW
POD1000000047_S0000226 WITH NUMBERS AND HOW THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE OF THE END THE WHOLE ARE ALWAYS CONSTRUCTED SOMEONE IS CHOSEN WHAT TO MEASURE AND IS THAT THEY TEND TO EITHER ACCEPT THEM AS IF THEIR GOD GIVEN TRUTH AND THAT'S EITHER THE NUMBER AND THAT'S SO VITAL
POD1000000047_S0000227 AND THAT IS IT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OR REJECT THEM OUT OF HAND OH YOU CAN'T PUT A NUMBER
POD1000000047_S0000229 DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS OF THIS LITTLE MONSTERS AND THAT SORT OF THOSE TWO EXTREME VIEWS ARE BOTH EQUALLY THE
POD1000000047_S0000231 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED VIEW YOU'LL REALIZE THAT STATISTICS NUMBERS AND MEASUREMENT ARE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TOOL BUT THEY'RE JUST A TOOL AND THEY HAVE THEIR FRAILTIES AND INADEQUACY SO YOU BOTH NEED TO
POD1000000047_S0000233 TEACH AND UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS AND WHAT I'M INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO DO JUST THAT
POD1000000047_S0000235 SO IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF TRYING TO ASSIGN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT TO EACH DIFFERENT KIND OF EVIDENCE OR EACH DIFFERENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT COMES YOUR WAY
POD1000000047_S0000236 I THINK I MEAN IN THE END WHAT STATISTICS IS IS TO DO WITH ITS QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE THAT'S WHAT IT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND AND EVIDENCE CAN BE GOOD BAD OR YOU KNOW ALONG A WHOLE SCALE IS NOT A TRUE OR FALSE
POD1000000047_S0000237 IT'S JUST EVIDENCE AND YOU TRY TO WORRY ABOUT EVIDENCE WHICH WE DO ALL THE TIME AND I LINES WE DO THIS BUT YOU KNOW I'VE GOT TO TEND TO BE A BIT FALLIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WEARING OF EVIDENCE
POD1000000047_S0000239 TO INFLUENCE MYSELF AND SAYING THINGS THAT WILL ATTRACT OUR ATTENTION AND SO AS YOU STANDING BACK AND TRYING TO BE A BIT COOLER AT WEIGHING OF EVIDENCE LEADING IS A REALLY VALUABLE THING TO TRY TO DO IN ALL AREAS OF LIFE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
POD1000000047_S0000240 YEAH ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD COMPLETELY DISCOUNT THAT GUT FEELING THAT OFTEN JUST SUPPLEMENT IT WITH SOME ACCEPTANCE OR STATISTICS
POD1000000047_S0000241 LIKE GOT MY GOD
POD1000000047_S0000243 I DON'T TRUST HIM A BIT BUT I STILL YOU KNOW GO WITH ME
POD1000000047_S0000244 YEAH I THINK THAT'S IT BUT WE GOT TIME FOR NOW BUT THANKS SO MUCH DAVID THIS HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE AND REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000047_S0000245 OKAY THANKS VERY
POD1000000047_S0000247 RIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE FROM PROFESSOR SPIEGEL HOTTER THEN YOU CAN FIND HIS BLOG UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY ONLINE AND HE'S ALSO OFTEN ON THE RADIO IN THE UK IN PARTICULAR ON MORE OR LESS ON BBC FOUR
POD1000000048_S0000001 HI I'M ROB DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT 80,000 HOURS TODAY I'M SPEAKING WITH MILES BRUNDAGE RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD'S FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE
POD1000000048_S0000002 HE STUDIES THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS SURROUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND HAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS AN AI SYSTEM THAT COULD DO MOST OR ALL OF THE TASKS HUMANS COULD DO
POD1000000048_S0000003 MILES RESEARCH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION THE BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER AND THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO TALK TO US TODAY MILES
POD1000000048_S0000004 THANKS FOR HAVING ME
POD1000000048_S0000005 SO FIRST UP MAYBE JUST TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT QUESTIONS YOU'RE LOOKING INTO AT THE MOMENT
POD1000000048_S0000007 SURE SO I USED TO WORK ON ENERGY POLICY WHEN I WAS LIVING IN WASHINGTON DC AND I'VE GRADUALLY MOVED INTO A I POLICY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS MORE OF A NEGLECTED AREA AND COULD HAVE A VERY LARGE IMPACT
POD1000000048_S0000008 SO I RECENTLY STARTED AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND I'M ALSO CONCURRENTLY FINISHING UP MY PHD IN HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY
POD1000000048_S0000009 SO IN BOTH CAPACITIES I AM INTERESTED IN WHAT SORTS OF METHODS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THINKING ABOUT AI IN A RIGOROUS WAY AND PARTICULARLY THE UNCERTAINTY OF POSSIBLE FUTURES SURROUNDING A
POD1000000048_S0000010 AND I HAVE A FEW MORE SPECIFIC INTEREST SUCH AS OPENNESS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE RISKS RELATED TO BAD ACTORS
POD1000000048_S0000011 OKAY SO ARE YOU TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHEN AND WHAT SORT OF EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE
POD1000000048_S0000012 SO NOT NECESSARILY PREDICT PER SE BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT'S PLAUSIBLE I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH ANY HIGH CONFIDENCE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHEN
POD1000000048_S0000013 BUT UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT SORTS OF ACTIONS PEOPLE COULD CARRY OUT WITH AI SYSTEMS TODAY OR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS LIKE CYBER SECURITY
POD1000000048_S0000014 AND INFORMATION OPERATIONS PRODUCTION OF FAKE NEWS AUTOMATICALLY AND AUTONOMOUS DRONES AND SO FORTH
POD1000000048_S0000015 I THINK UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY LANDSCAPE OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE VERY DETAILED FORECAST OF WHEN EXACTLY SOMETHING WILL OCCUR SO MUCH AS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE GIVEN NEAR TERM
POD1000000048_S0000017 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY THIS IS WHEN THE THIS PARTICULAR ACCIDENT OR MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR WILL OCCUR BUT JUST THAT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF RISKS THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR
POD1000000048_S0000018 RIGHT RIGHT DOES THAT BRING YOU INTO CONTACT WITH WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPING A EYES LIKE LIKE GOOGLE
POD1000000048_S0000020 YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AN INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT AI IS AS BENEFICIAL AS
POD1000000048_S0000022 KEENLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BE MISUSED AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ACCIDENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
POD1000000048_S0000023 SO FOR EXAMPLE I HELD A WORKSHOP FAIRLY RECENTLY ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BAD ACTORS AND AI AND WHAT SORTS OF BAD ACTORS WE MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS SPACE AND WE HAD SOME PARTICIPATION FROM SOME OF THOSE GROUPS
POD1000000048_S0000024 RIGHT RIGHT WHAT KINDS OF BAD ACTORS ARE YOU THINKING OF
POD1000000048_S0000025 I THINK THERE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES SO DEPENDING ON THE DOMAIN THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN YOU MIGHT END UP WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF
POD1000000048_S0000026 SO IN THE CASE OF PHYSICAL HARM ASSOCIATED WITH AI YOU MIGHT LOOK AT AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES AND IN THAT CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY APPEALING TO STATE ACTORS AS WELL AS
POD1000000048_S0000027 WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH AUTONOMY IF ANY IN THE CASE OF ISIS OVERSEAS
POD1000000048_S0000028 SO THERE ARE CASES LIKE THAT WHERE WE CAN FORESEE THAT PARTICULAR GROUPS WITH WOODEN GIVEN MORE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS HIGHER BASELINE LEVELS OF AUTONOMY AND CONSUMER DRONES
POD1000000048_S0000029 WOULD LIKE WOULD BE ABLE TO AND WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OUT DAMAGE ON A LARGER SCALE
POD1000000048_S0000030 BUT IN OTHER CASES IT'S LESS CLEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND MASS SURVEILLANCE AND IT'S OFTEN NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER ONE SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT STATES OR CORPORATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000031 DEPENDING ON WHAT SORTS OF RISKIER CONCERNED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE CORPORATIONS CURRENTLY HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000032 THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE USE OF AI TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT HAVE CRITICAL IMPACTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES
POD1000000048_S0000033 JUST DENYING LOANS AND COURT DECISIONS AND SO FORTH THAT ARE BEING INFORMED BY OFTEN NOT VERY TRANSPARENT ALGORITHMS
POD1000000048_S0000034 SO THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS BUT THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT CLASS OF CONCERNS AROUND AUTHORITARIAN STATES USING AI FOR OPPRESSION
POD1000000048_S0000035 SO IT'S I THINK THERE'S A RANGE OF RISKS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE'S GOING TO BE A STEADY INCREASE IN THE THE THE FLOOR OF THE SKILL LEVEL AS THESE AI TECHNOLOGY IS
POD1000000048_S0000036 THAT IS THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE THAT IS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WITH MORE ACCESS TO COMPUTING POWER AND MONEY AND DATA AT THE HIGHER
POD1000000048_S0000037 SO IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU MIGHT EXPECT THAT
POD1000000048_S0000038 THE THE BIGGEST ACTORS ARE THE MOST CONCERNING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST SKILL AND RESOURCES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALSO ARE SOMETIMES IN THE CASE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS
POD1000000048_S0000039 HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO CITIZENS AND IN THE CASE OF CORPORATIONS HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL ROGUE ACTORS
POD1000000048_S0000040 SO AT THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE I'M STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REPORT THAT I'M WRITING BASED ON THAT WORKSHOP
POD1000000048_S0000041 RIGHT SO PEOPLE OFTEN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE KIND OF THE SHORT TERM RISKS FROM A I LIKE SELF DRIVING CARS NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ALGORITHMIC BIAS
POD1000000048_S0000042 AND THEN THE LONGER TERM CONCERNS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ONCE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AS SMART AS HUMANS ARE POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT WHAT WHICH ONE OF THOSE DO YOU SPEND MORE TIME WORKING ON
POD1000000048_S0000043 I TRY TO FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT ARE SPAN DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS SO I THINK AI AND SECURITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME EARLY INSTANCES OF TODAY
POD1000000048_S0000044 SO IT'S ALREADY BEING USED FOR DETECTION OF CYBER THREATS FOR EXAMPLE AND THE PRODUCTION OF VULNERABILITIES AND SOFTWARE THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING ON
POD1000000048_S0000045 NIGHT WITH AN EXAMPLE BEING THE DARPA GRAND CYBER OUR CYBER GRAND CHALLENGE RECENTLY WHERE THERE'S AUTOMATED HACKING AND AUTOMATED DEFENSE
POD1000000048_S0000046 SO THERE'S ALREADY STUFF HAPPENING ON THE FRONT OF AI AND SECURITY AS WELL AS THE ECONOMICS OF AI AND SO ISSUES SURROUNDING PRIVACY
POD1000000048_S0000047 BUT IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER THE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE WILL JUST BE STRAIGHTFORWARD EXTENSIONS OF THOSE OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT
POD1000000048_S0000049 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AND IMAGINE HOW IT MIGHT PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP INTO A MORE EXTREME FUTURE AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES WHEN AI PROGRESSES MORE QUICKLY
POD1000000048_S0000050 RIGHT RIGHT SO I SHOULD SAY THIS POINT THAT WE HAVE A PROFILE UP ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THE BASIC
POD1000000048_S0000051 AND MILES YOU HAVE A FORTHCOMING GUIDE TO WORK ON AI POLICY AND STRATEGY THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LINK TO SO SO HERE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GO GO BEYOND THAT SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED THEN POTENTIALLY JUST GO AND READ ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FIRST
POD1000000048_S0000052 SO SO WHICH POLICY OR STRATEGY QUESTION IS DO YOU SEE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR US TO ANSWER IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOES GOES WELL RATHER THAN IN A BAD WAY
POD1000000048_S0000053 I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THE ONES I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER SURROUNDING SECURITY AND AND PREVENTING THE WEAPONIZATION OF A I BUY A DANGEROUS ACTORS IS ONE
POD1000000048_S0000054 BUT ONE AND THEY'RE ALSO OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA AND BY ACADEMICS SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALGORITHMS AND TRANSPARENCY THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF AI AND SO FORTH
POD1000000048_S0000055 BUT ONE THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY OVER THE LONG OVER THE LONG TERM AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A NEED TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES
POD1000000048_S0000056 IS COORDINATION SURROUNDING AI SAFETY SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION CALLED TO AI SAFETY AND THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THEY'RE STARTING TO BE A LOT OF CONCRETE AND SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM OF AVOIDING CERTAIN AI SAFETY FAILURE
POD1000000048_S0000057 LIKE WIRE HEADING AND VALUE MISALIGNMENT AND SO FORTH BUT THERE'S BEEN LESS ATTENTION PAID TO HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO ACT ON THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE THE GOOD THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE
POD1000000048_S0000058 ASSUMING THAT THEY WILL BE DEVELOPED AND THAT'S A POTENTIALLY BIG PROBLEM IF THERE'S A COMPETITIVE SITUATION BETWEEN COMPANIES OR BETWEEN COUNTRIES OR BOTH AND THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP ON THOSE SAFETY MEASURES
POD1000000048_S0000059 SO THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK FOR EXAMPLE BY ARMSTRONG AT ALL AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE LOOKING AT ARMS RACE TYPE SCENARIOS INVOLVING AI WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP
POD1000000048_S0000060 BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THE LEAD IN AN AI RACE AND THERE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EXTENT WILL
POD1000000048_S0000061 BUT THERE IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF AI SYSTEM SO ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO IN ORDER TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE WHETHER ECONOMIC OR MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE WISE
POD1000000048_S0000062 RAMP UP THE CAPABILITIES OF AN AI SYSTEM BY ADDING MORE HARDWARE ADDING MORE DATA ADDING MORE SENSORS AND EFFECTORS AND SO FORTH BUT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THE FULL BEHAVIORAL ENVELOPE OF THE
POD1000000048_S0000063 SO TO SPEAK AND HOW TO CONSTRAIN ACTORS THE HUMID ACTORS FROM DOING THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM
POD1000000048_S0000064 SO I'VE ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND OTHERS A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE STARTED THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS AN INCENTIVE COMPATIBLE MECHANISM TO ENSURE
POD1000000048_S0000065 THAT PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING IN THAT CASE THAT IS TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO ASK PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS
POD1000000048_S0000066 IF THEY ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING THESE SYSTEMS AND PROTECTING THEMSELVES MILITARILY OR OTHERWISE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE CONSTRAINED IN SOME SORT OF WAY
POD1000000048_S0000067 SO ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE AN ARRANGED THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A FULLY FLESHED OUT EXAMPLE BUT JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE SORT OF THING I'M TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000048_S0000068 WOULD BE SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN AI DEVELOPERS SUCH THAT IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LATEST BREAKTHROUGHS OR THE LATEST COMPUTING POWER
POD1000000048_S0000069 YOU WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT TO SOME SORT OF SAFETY MONITORING AND AND ADHERE TO CERTAIN BEST PRACTICES
POD1000000048_S0000070 THAT WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE IF YOU WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE SAFETY PROTOCOLS SO THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S NOT A FULLY WORKED OUT
POD1000000048_S0000071 THAT'S THAT'S THE CLASS OF THING THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLASS OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF SO DEVELOPING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT THING THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED ON THE TECHNICAL FRONT ACTUALLY GETS IMPLEMENTED
POD1000000048_S0000072 RYAN DID YOU LOOK MUCH AT SAY WHAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING IN THIS AREA WHETHER THERE'S REGULATIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING IN PLACE OR AT LEAST PREPARING TO PUT IN PLACE IN FUTURE
POD1000000048_S0000073 YEAH SO I THINK THAT THAT TIES IN WITH WHAT I WAS SAYING A LITTLE BIT IN THAT ONE MIGHT ENVISION THAT AS AI CAPABILITIES
POD1000000048_S0000074 THIRD WILL BE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT A COUNTRY BE ON THE LEADING EDGE SO I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT YET
POD1000000048_S0000075 I THINK THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT SO CLEARLY IN MY OPINION IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR COUNTRIES TO HAVE SOME EXPERTS IN HOUSE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT AI
POD1000000048_S0000076 AND ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CRISIS AS THEY ARISE IF THEY ARISE AND TO BE ABLE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF AI ON THE LABOR FORCE FOR EXAMPLE
POD1000000048_S0000077 SO I THINK THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT AND SOME POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR DEALING WITH SOME OF THE NEAR TERM ISSUES BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM ISSUES
POD1000000048_S0000078 IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO RUSH INTO INTO A SITUATION WHERE GOVERNMENTS ARE LEADING THIS IF THAT WOULD TURN OUT TO ONLY ACCENTUATE THE ARMS RACE
POD1000000048_S0000079 WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO AVOID IF IT'S IF AI IS SEEN EVEN MORE AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE IN A NONE HARM ON A HELPFUL WAY
POD1000000048_S0000080 SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THOSE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM POLICY ISSUES AROUND AI TO DEVELOP A MORE POSITIVE PROPOSAL THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST
POD1000000048_S0000081 YOU KNOW THE US GOVERNMENT GETTING INVOLVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACCELERATING AMERICAN AI
POD1000000048_S0000082 BUT SOME MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH
POD1000000048_S0000083 YEAH I SUPPOSE WITH WITH PREVIOUS DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES LIKE LIKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THERE'S THERE'S BEEN AGREEMENTS TO TRY TO SLOW DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN HERE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
POD1000000048_S0000085 I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF SLOWING DOWN AMONG A SMALL NUMBER OF ACTORS
POD1000000048_S0000086 AND WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT THERE IS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF COMPUTING POWER AND TALENT AND SKILL IN A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000087 SO THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO CHANCE OF SOME RANDOM PERSON OUT COMPETING YOU KNOW THE TOP ORGANIZATIONS THAT AI IN A SURPRISING WAY
POD1000000048_S0000088 SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WITH WITH SOME OF THE TOP COMPANIES AND NONPROFITS AS WELL AS COUNTRIES THEY COULD COORDINATE IN SOME SORT OF WAY
POD1000000048_S0000089 NOT TO POSTPONE A I ACROSS SOCIETY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT AT LEAST TO BE CAUTIOUS IN THE LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND TO ALLOW TIME FOR MUTUAL VETTING OF SAFETY PROCEDURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
POD1000000048_S0000090 SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF COORDINATION BUT THE THE TECHNICAL AND THE POLITICAL FACTORS INTERACT TO A LARGE EXTENT
POD1000000048_S0000091 TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE EFFICIENT AND THAT DON'T INTRODUCE A LOT OF OVERHEAD COMPUTATIONAL OR OTHERWISE INTO THESE SYSTEMS
POD1000000048_S0000092 THEN WE'LL BE IN A BETTER PLACE TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO COORDINATE BECAUSE IT WON'T BE IMPOSING A LOT OF COSTS ON THEM AND LIKEWISE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COORDINATE BETTER
POD1000000048_S0000093 IT WILL WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE THOSE MECHANISMS IF THEY DO IMPOSE SOME PERFORMANCE PENALTY
POD1000000048_S0000094 RIGHT SO YOU CAN YOU THINK OF LIKE EDDIE MAJOR BITS OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON AI STRATEGY QUESTIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
POD1000000048_S0000095 SO THE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED OF THE PAPER BY ARMSTRONG AT ALL CALLED THE RACING TO THE PRECIPICE IS ONE EXAMPLE AND IT PRESENTED SORT OF A STARK VERSION OF THE ARMS RACE SCENARIO
POD1000000048_S0000096 I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE REASONS TO BE OR MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN THAN ARE PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT ONLY A CERTAIN SET OF ASSUMPTIONS AS WITH ANY MODEL
POD1000000048_S0000097 BUT MORE GENERALLY I THINK THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR GOOD POLICIES IN RECENT YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE ASILOMAR CONFERENCE AND A SET OF ASILOMAR AI
POD1000000048_S0000098 I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD STEP TOWARDS DEVELOPING SOME SHARED UNDERSTANDING OR ON THE NEED TO AVOID ARMS RACES AND CONCERNS OVER AI WEAPONIZATION AND SO FORTH
POD1000000048_S0000099 BUT IT'S I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR
POD1000000048_S0000100 PROGRESS TO BE MADE SO THERE WAS A PAPER PUT OUT BY THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE BY NICK BOSTROM KIRK FLYNN AND ALAN DEFOE RECENTLY THAT LOOKS AT POLICY DESIDERATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE SUPERINTELLIGENCE
POD1000000048_S0000101 AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD MATERIAL THERE BUT I THINK THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT WE'RE STILL AT THE THE HIGH LEVEL PRINCIPAL STAGE OF DEVELOPING THESE POLICIES
POD1000000048_S0000102 SO WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID THEN THEN WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHAT SORTS OF WHAT WHAT A GOOD PROPOSAL SEE PROPOSAL WOULD LOOK LIKE
POD1000000048_S0000103 BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE ANYTHING SUPER ACTIONABLE SO I THINK THE SITUATION IS A BIT ANALOGOUS TO WEAR AI SAFETY WAS A FEW YEARS AGO
POD1000000048_S0000104 WE'RE THERE WERE THERE WAS STARTING TO BE AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE BOOK SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER PUBLICATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000105 AND PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO TAKE THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY AND STARTED TO HAVE A VOCABULARY FOR WHAT WHAT SOLUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH THE VALUE ALIGNMENT AND OTHER TERMS BEING COINED
POD1000000048_S0000106 BUT THERE WASN'T YET ANY CONCRETE RESEARCH AGENDA AND YOU KNOW SUBSEQUENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONCRETE RESEARCH AGENDAS
POD1000000048_S0000107 WELL AS TECHNICAL PROGRESS ON SOME PARTS OF THOSE RESEARCH AGENDAS WITH WORK BY OPEN AI AND DEEPMIND AND OTHERS LEADING THE WAY
POD1000000048_S0000108 SO I THINK THAT WE'RE POTENTIALLY IN A SIMILARLY EXCITING PHASE ON THE EYE POLICY FRONT WHERE WE HAVE A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND WITH THE EXAMPLE OF AVOIDING ARMS RACES BEING FOREFRONT IN MY
POD1000000048_S0000109 LEAST BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE A CONCRETE WE DON'T HAVE YOU NO CLEARER MODELS AND CASE STUDIES THAT WE CAN POINT TO AS WAYS FORWARD
POD1000000048_S0000110 SO I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT STEP IS MOVING INTO MORE CONCRETE PROPOSALS AND TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN RECENT PAPERS
POD1000000048_S0000112 SO IT SEEMS LIKE EXCUSE ME IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE LATEST THINKING IN THIS AREA ISN'T WRITTEN UP IN PUBLIC YET PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUBLICIZE THEIR VIEWS AT THIS POINT OR JUST BECAUSE THE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET PAPERS PUBLISHED
POD1000000048_S0000113 WHAT DO YOU THINKS THE BEST WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THE AREA TO GET UP TO SPEED ON THE ISSUES
POD1000000048_S0000114 SO I THINK AGAIN IT'S SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE SITUATION WITH AI SAFETY A FEW YEARS AGO AND I THINK THE BOOK SUPER INTELLIGENCE WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF HAVING A SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO
POD1000000048_S0000115 BUT IT'S LESS CLEAR IF THERE'S ONE SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO ON AI POLICY ISSUES THOUGH I'M HOPING HOPING THAT THE CAREER GUIDE THAT I'M WORKING ON WILL BE SOMEWHAT USEFUL IN THAT REGARD
POD1000000048_S0000116 ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT COMES TO MIND IS A SYLLABUS FOR CLASS ON THE GLOBAL POLITICS OF A I DEVELOPED BY ALAN DEFOE AT YALE AND THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE
POD1000000048_S0000117 THAT THAT'S A VERY DETAILED LIST OF RESOURCES AND I I'M SURE THEY'LL BE A LINK PROVIDED FOR FOR THIS INTERVIEW SOMEWHERE
POD1000000048_S0000118 
POD1000000048_S0000119 AND YES I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER SET OF RESOURCES SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LONG LIST OF BOTH FORMAL ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS THINGS IN THE MORE GREY LITERATURE
POD1000000048_S0000120 SUCH AS BLOG POSTS WHICH IS I THINK THE SORT OF THING YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS YOU KNOW THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY WRITTEN UP ACADEMICALLY BUT ARE YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE BUT EVEN THERE THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW GOOGLE DOCS THAT ARE USED INTERNALLY AND SO
POD1000000048_S0000121 SO I THINK IF IF BASED ON READING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEN THE OBVIOUS NEXT STEP IS JUST TO GET IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND ASKED AND YOU KNOW INDICATE WHAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE
POD1000000048_S0000122 THERE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE ONLINE THEY CAN POINT YOU TO
POD1000000048_S0000123 YEAH YOU MENTIONED THE ASILOMAR STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES WHICH JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE THAT
POD1000000048_S0000124 SURE SO
POD1000000048_S0000125 TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CONFERENCE ON BENEFICIAL AI HELD IN PUERTO RICO AND THAT LED TO AN OPEN AN OPEN LETTER ON AI
POD1000000048_S0000126 AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOME INVESTMENT BY ELON MUSK IN THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE WHICH SUPPORTED A LOT OF GRANTS IN THIS SPACE
POD1000000048_S0000127 AND I THINK THAT THAT LED TO A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING A LOT OF AI SCIENTISTS WHO SIGNED ON TO THAT LETTER
POD1000000048_S0000128 AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THE ASILOMAR AI PRINCIPLES WHICH WERE DEVELOPED AT A CONFERENCE TWO YEARS LATER THIS YEAR AT ASILOMAR IN CALIFORNIA
POD1000000048_S0000129 DEVELOPED A MORE SPECIFIC SET OF PROPOSALS FOR WHAT SORTS OF THINGS AI SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SO NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE RESEARCH BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE CAPABILITY
POD1000000048_S0000130 SO BEING ATTENTIVE TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF AI CAPABILITIES WILL ULTIMATELY BE
POD1000000048_S0000131 AND THE THINGS I MENTIONED ABOUT AVOIDING ARMS RACES AND BEING CONCERNED ABOUT AI WEAPONIZATION MORE BROADLY SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF DEVELOPING YOU KNOW SORT OF A CONSENSUS VIEW ON WHAT
POD1000000048_S0000132 WHAT WE WANT TO SEE AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO SEE A I BENEFITING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT YOU KNOW LEADING TO THE ACCRUING OF BENEFITS TO A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR TO LARGE SCALE WAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
POD1000000048_S0000133 AND I THINK IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE NOT JUST THAT BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SETS OF PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE IEEE AND THEIR RF THEIR EFFORT ON ETHICALLY ALIGNED AI DESIGN
POD1000000048_S0000134 SO WRITE THOSE THOSE PRINCIPLES AND THEY SEEMED QUITE STRONG ON PAPER DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEM
POD1000000048_S0000135 I THINK I THINK THERE'S SOMEWHAT OF A GAP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION OF THE PRINCIPLES AND AND CONCRETE STEPS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE
POD1000000048_S0000136 SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHAT ANY INDIVIDUAL CAN CAN DO TO STOP AN ARMS RACE FOR EXAMPLE BUT I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO KNOW WHERE WHERE YOU'RE HEADED
POD1000000048_S0000137 THEN FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT IS IS THE NEXT STEP
POD1000000048_S0000138 SO IN YOUR GUIDE YOU SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE COULD POTENTIALLY WORK ON AI STRATEGY AND POLICY QUESTIONS AT PLACES LIKE GOOGLE DEEPMIND OR OPEN A EYEWEAR WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ACTUALLY BEING DEVELOPED
POD1000000048_S0000139 WHAT CONCRETELY COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE DOING AT PLACES LIKE THAT IF THEY TOOK A JOB THERE
POD1000000048_S0000140 YEAH SO TO SOME EXTENT PEOPLE AT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING SOMETHING FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE DOING IN ACADEMIA
POD1000000048_S0000141 IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND TRYING TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS I THINK THE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS IS TO HAVE MORE DIRECT EXPOSURE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK
POD1000000048_S0000142 IN AI DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK THAT CAN BE USEFUL FOR DEVELOPING A SET OF WHAT SORTS OF PROBLEMS ARE ACTUALLY CROPPING UP AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONES IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000048_S0000143 THOUGH I THINK IT'S ALSO NOTABLE THAT PEOPLE AT THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THE THE EFFORTS THAT I'VE MENTIONED SUCH AS RAISING ATTENTION TO AI SAFETY
POD1000000048_S0000144 WHICH WAS AN INITIATIVE THAT INVOLVES PEOPLE AT GOOGLE BRAIN AND OPEN AI IN THE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN AI SAFETY PAPER
POD1000000048_S0000145 AND PEOPLE AT DEEPMIND HAVE BEEN VERY INFLUENTIAL IN CALLING FOR MORE AI SAFETY WORK AND THEY'VE BEEN PUBLISHING FAIRLY EARLY ON THIS MATTER RELATIVE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000146 SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF REASON TO THINK THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLAYING A POSITIVE ROLE AND I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO BE INVOLVED IN SORT OF THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON THESE
POD1000000048_S0000147 X AS WELL AS DOING DIRECTORY SEARCH
POD1000000048_S0000149 HOW HARD IS IT TO GET A JOB AT A PLACE LIKE THAT
POD1000000048_S0000151 IMAGINE THAT ONLY HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WORKING ON AI STRATEGY OR POLICY THESE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE ROLES
POD1000000048_S0000152 I WOULD SAY THEY'RE PRETTY COMPETITIVE AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW A GENERAL PHENOMENON IN ANYTHING RELATED TO A I THESE DAYS YOU KNOW WHETHER ON THE POLICY SIDE OR THE TECHNICAL SIDE
POD1000000048_S0000153 BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A GROWTH AREA FOR SURE SO IF ONE DEVELOPS EXPERTISE IN THIS TOPIC AND HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE
POD1000000048_S0000154 THEN I THINK THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS
POD1000000048_S0000155 AGAIN I WANT TO DRAW AN ANALOGY TO A I SAFETY WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW WILL THERE BE JOBS AND AI SAFETY YOU KNOW THREE YEARS OR SO AGO AND I THINK THAT DETERRED SOME GRAD STUDENTS FROM WORKING IN THE SPACE
POD1000000048_S0000156 NOW THE SITUATION SEEMS TO LOOK A BIT BETTER IN THAT THERE'S A FAIR NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR POSTDOCS AND PEOPLE BEING HIRED AT TOP TOP LABS TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES
POD1000000048_S0000157 SO I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE SOMETHING PRETTY SIMILAR NOT NECESSARILY IT BECOMING NOT COMPETITIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE BIT OF SLACKENING OVER TIME AS AS THERE'S A NEED FOR DEVELOPING LARGER TEAMS TO WORK ON THESE TOPICS
POD1000000048_S0000159 AND ANOTHER PATH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IS GOING INTO POLITICS OR POLICY ROLES FOR EXAMPLE AS A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER OR PERHAPS AT A THINK TANK LIKE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE OR THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OR POTENTIALLY JUST GOING INTO PARTY POLITICS IN GENERAL
POD1000000048_S0000160 WHAT USEFUL THINGS DO YOU ENVISAGE PEOPLE COULD DO THAT
POD1000000048_S0000162 YES SO I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT WORKING AT NAI LAB WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S PRACTICAL ON THE TECHNICAL
POD1000000048_S0000163 WORKING FOR CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT OR YOU KNOW POLITICAL PARTY WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S PRACTICAL ON THE POLITICAL FRONT
POD1000000048_S0000164 SO IN ADDITION TO THAT IT DEVELOPING A BETTER INTUITION FOR THE THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND WHAT'S WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE
POD1000000048_S0000165 I THINK IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY A GOOD WAY TO INTO ACTUALLY INFLUENCE WHAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY DONE BY THOSE BODIES
POD1000000048_S0000166 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE US CONGRESS RIGHT NOW THERE WAS JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN AI CAUCUS TO ORGANIZE THE DISCUSSION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON ISSUES RELATED TO A
POD1000000048_S0000167 WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUTURE OF WORK BUT I THINK OVER TIME WE'LL SEE MORE DISCUSSION OF THE LONGER TERM SORTS OF ISSUES
POD1000000048_S0000168 THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THOSE FOUR AND IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT THING IS IS ULTIMATELY DONE WORKING IN THOSE PLACES
POD1000000048_S0000169 ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACT ON THE BEST THE BEST CURRENT UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS AND BY PRACTITIONERS
POD1000000048_S0000170 YEAH SO I WOULD THINK A BIG RISK OF GOING INTO POLITICS OR POLICY IN GENERAL WOULD BE THAT YOUR CAREER PROGRESSES BUT YOU'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY IN ONE OF THE PLACES THAT ENDS UP HAVING A SAY IN HOW THESE THINGS GO
POD1000000048_S0000171 YOU JUST END UP YOU KNOW BEING YOU KNOW WORKING IN A IN A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THAT RELEVANT THERE ANY ROLES THAT YOU CAN TAKE EARLY ON OR WHAT CAN YOU DO TO MAKE IT TO POSITION YOURSELF WELL SO THAT YOU DON'T JUST GET SIDELINED IN THE END
POD1000000048_S0000173 I THINK IF YOU INTEND TO WORK IN POLITICS AND YOU HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT OPPORTUNISTIC ABOUT JOBS AND THE EBB AND FLOW OF POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE
POD1000000048_S0000174 IF YOU KNOW ONE ONE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS DECLINING AND ITS RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF AI THEN ONE SHOULD CONSIDER ABOUT YOU KNOW JUMPING SHIP TOWARDS SOMEWHERE THAT'S MORE RELEVANT
POD1000000048_S0000175 SO I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW AT TAKING ONE PARTICULAR JOB WILL LOCK YOU IN FOREVER BUT BUILDING UP SOME POLITICAL CAPITAL AND SOME HUMAN CAPITAL IN THAT AREA COULD BE USEFUL
POD1000000048_S0000176 EVEN IF YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION BUT I WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA OF NOT NOT BEING RELEVANT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AT THE ON THE SIDE OF PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000177 YOU'RE NOT AT THE AT THE ORGANIZATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING THE LATEST A I MEAN AS I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK THAT'S A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AND YOU KNOW ALONG WITH ACADEMIA IT'S A GREAT GREAT PLACE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES
POD1000000048_S0000178 BUT GOVERNMENTS STILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FRAMING THESE ISSUES AND IN CONVENING DISCUSSION
POD1000000048_S0000179 AN EXAMPLE OF AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT PUT OUT BY THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY LAST
POD1000000048_S0000180 WHICH YOU KNOW WAS THE RESULTS OF FOUR WORKSHOPS THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER EXPERTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS AND LAW AND ECONOMICS AND AI TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY
POD1000000048_S0000181 AND SO I THINK YOU STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION AND MOVE THE BALL FORWARD EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING AND IN THE LATEST LABS
POD1000000048_S0000182 YEAH SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE BEST PLACES TO TO APPLY TO IN THAT AREA
POD1000000048_S0000183 SO IT'S IT'S A BIT TRICKY TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL AND DEPENDS ON FACTORS LIKE WHAT YOUR CITIZENSHIP IS AND WHAT PARTICULAR POLICY ISSUES YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
POD1000000048_S0000184 BUT SOME FAIRLY ROBUST RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE TO LOOK FOR FOR FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS
POD1000000048_S0000185 ONE AREA TO LOOK AT WOULD BE AAA S FELLOWSHIP SO THE AMERICAN AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE HAS A FELLOWSHIP
POD1000000048_S0000186 WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT PEOPLE IN ROTATIONS IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHERE THEY CAN IMPLEMENT SOME OF SOME THEY CAN DRAW ON THEIR TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE
POD1000000048_S0000187 SEND SOMEONE WITH IT BACKGROUND AND A I WOULD PROBABLY END UP IN AN AI RELEVANT ORGANIZATION SO I'VE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT BEING A GOOD GOOD WAY TO DEVELOP CAREER CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS
POD1000000048_S0000188 BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO RESULT IN BEING IN THE EXACT RIGHT LOCATION FOR FOR YOU KNOW SOLVING AI POLICY PROBLEMS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
POD1000000048_S0000189 I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WHERE WHERE THAT WOULD BE OR EVEN IF THERE IS SUCH A PLACE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE STILL
POD1000000048_S0000190 DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE IN A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE SO THERE THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A RECOMMENDATION THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A NOMINATION FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
POD1000000048_S0000191 SO OTHERWISE I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS A GOOD PLACE TO GO SO AT LIKEWISE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ON THE AI FRONT
POD1000000048_S0000192 AND THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION BUT NOT MUCH INSTITUTION BUILDING IN IN GOVERNMENTS AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL
POD1000000048_S0000193 BUT I THINK GETTING EXPERIENCE AS A PRETTY ROBUST THING TO DO
POD1000000048_S0000194 RIGHT RIGHT SO SITUATION THAT I ENCOUNTER REASONABLY OFTEN IS THAT MEET SOMEONE WHO'S REALLY SMART WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION
POD1000000048_S0000195 BUT AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE JUST THERE AREN'T THAT MANY GROUPS THAT ARE HIRING FOR THESE ROLES SO FOR SO YOU'RE AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND I GUESS THERE'S ALSO THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES THAT SOMEONE CAN POTENTIALLY APPLY
POD1000000048_S0000196 SOMETHING OF WHAT HAVE I SHOULD ACTUALLY GIVE SOMEONE IN THAT SITUATION SHOULD THEY JUST SHOULD THEY CONTINUE STUDYING PERHAPS OR YOU KNOW BUILDING EXPERTISE SO THAT THEY'RE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PLAN FUTURE WHEN WHEN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS GROWS OR YEAH
POD1000000048_S0000197 UM YEAH I MEAN AGAIN IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT
POD1000000048_S0000198 BACKGROUND THE PERSON HAS AND WHAT SORTS OF JOBS ARE INTERESTED IN BUT I THINK IF ONE CASA FAIRLY LARGE NET IN TERMS OF WHAT AI ISSUES ONE WANTS TO WORK ON THERE'S A FAIR FAIRLY LARGE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000199 IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST FHI THERE'S ALSO THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EXISTENTIAL RISK THE LEVERHULME CENTRE FOR THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE THE TECH POLICY LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
POD1000000048_S0000200 AND VARIOUS FACULTY PROGRAMS AROUND THE VARIOUS ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE LOOKING TO HIRE PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000201 FOR EXAMPLE AS POSTDOCS OR FACULTY MEMBER IN AREAS RELATED TO AI AND POLICY IF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT ACADEMIC BACKGROUND
POD1000000048_S0000202 AND THEY'RE PROBABLY A FAIR NUMBER OF PULSE OF POLICY POSITIONS AT TECH COMPANIES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SPECIFIC TO A I BUT THAT WOULD LEAD TO GETTING VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE BROAD AREA OF TECH POLICY
POD1000000048_S0000203 SO AGAIN YEAH I WON I GUESS TO GENERALIZE A BIT I WOULD RECOMMEND CASTING A FAIRLY LARGE NET AND YOU KNOW WORKING IN ADJACENT AREAS IF YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY WORK IN THE EXACT RIGHT RIGHT PLACE
POD1000000048_S0000204 BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF AREA WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AI POLICY FOR DECADES AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BREAK IN FOR THAT REASON IT'S MORE JUST THAT IT'S STILL A FIELD THAT'S GROWING
POD1000000048_S0000205 AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT GROWTH WILL STOP SO I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE BUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY NOW
POD1000000048_S0000206 THEN THEN YOU KNOW AGAIN TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE ON THE HORIZON AND AND TRY AND WORK IN ADJACENT FIELDS THAT MIGHT BE ONE THING TO CONSIDER
POD1000000048_S0000207 YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR SOMEONE SITTING OUT TRYING TO START A CAREER IN THIS AREA
POD1000000048_S0000208 DEPENDING ON ONE'S BACKGROUND I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGE WOULD BE BONING UP ON AREAS OF WEAKNESS
POD1000000048_S0000209 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A POLICY BACKGROUND YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT AI AND IF YOU HAVE A TECHNICAL BACKGROUND YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON LEARNING ABOUT POLICY
POD1000000048_S0000210 I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES CHALLENGES IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT THERE NOT BEING A SUPER CLEARLY ACCESSIBLE LITERATURE ON THE TOP
POD1000000048_S0000211 CAN I THINK THERE'S SOME EFFORT BEING GOING INTO A DRESSING THAT WITH A CAREER GUIDE AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY THAT I MENTIONED
POD1000000048_S0000212 BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT THERE'S ANY ANY SPECIFIC SET OF PITFALLS THAT I WOULD
POD1000000048_S0000213 PEOPLE AVOID BESIDES YOUR OWN NOT NEGLECTING THE THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY'RE WEAK AND YOU DON'T DON'T TRY AND REST ON YOUR LAURELS AND SAY TECHNICAL AREAS OR POLICY AREAS BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AREA
POD1000000048_S0000214 AND YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT SORTS OF DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND NOT JUST WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND THOUGH OF COURSE YOU WANT TO DRAW ON YOUR STRENGTHS
POD1000000048_S0000215 HMM I GUESS BECAUSE IT'S A FIELD THAT SAID IT'S FAIRLY EARLY STAGES AND IS AND IS GROWING QUICKLY
POD1000000048_S0000216 IT WOULD BE A GOOD FIT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS YOU KNOW REALLY ABLE TO SET THEIR OWN DIRECTION AND AND MEET PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY ATTRACT FUNDING TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO SOMEONE WHO'S YOU KNOW GOING TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WANT TO GO INTO
POD1000000048_S0000217 YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I YEAH IT'S AN AREA THAT'S EVOLVING AND I THINK A LOT A LOT OF THE ORGANIZATION
POD1000000048_S0000218 THAT EXIST TODAY AND I HAVE MENTIONED AS GOOD PLACES TO WORK AND SO FORTH DIDN'T EXIST FIVE YEARS AGO SO
POD1000000048_S0000220 YEAH SOME OF THEM DIDN'T EXIST ONE YEAR AGO SO IT'S AN AREA IN FLUX AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS WITH POLITICS
POD1000000048_S0000221 YOU SHOULD BE OPPORTUNISTIC ABOUT YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF WHAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE FOR YOU TO BE IN
POD1000000048_S0000222 BUT YEAH I THINK IT'S A VERY EXCITING AREA TO WORK IN AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEIR THEIR BACKGROUND
POD1000000048_S0000223 SO IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO COULD GO INTO ANY KIND OF ORGANIZATIONAL ROLE AND THAT'D BE A GOOD FIT FOR IT WHAT WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD YOU THINK IS MOST VALUABLE OUT OF EVERYTHING
POD1000000048_S0000225 MOST VALUABLE PERSON I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT
POD1000000048_S0000226 THAT HAVE IT THAT'S IT
POD1000000048_S0000227 
POD1000000048_S0000228 IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANY SAY VACANCY OUT THERE THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOU JUST WISH THAT SOMEONE SOMEONE COULD FILL IT
POD1000000048_S0000229 
POD1000000048_S0000231 I MEAN ONE WHEN A VACANCY THAT THAT COMES TO MIND IS FOR THE POLICY RESEARCHER POSITION AT DEEP MINE SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY HIRING FOR FOR SOMEONE TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT AI
POD1000000048_S0000232 SO I THINK YEAH THE THE CASE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO WORK IN A GOOD ROLE TO HAVE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN INFLUENCING THE CONVERSATION AROUND AI POLICY AND BEING EXPOSED TO THE LATEST
POD1000000048_S0000233 SO YEAH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'D BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT THEN AND YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY APPLY
POD1000000048_S0000234 SO SOMETIMES I FIND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK ON AI POLICY BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS QUITE CUT OUT FOR TECHNICAL RESEARCH COULD PERHAPS BECAUSE THEIR MATH SKILLS AREN'T QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
POD1000000048_S0000235 IS THAT A SENSIBLE WAY TO GO OR IS IN SOME WAYS THAT THE I STRATEGY WORK HARDER JUST BECAUSE IT'S LESS CLEAR THAT IT'S LESS PRECISE THAN TECHNICAL WORK
POD1000000048_S0000236 UM I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S HARDER EASIER IT'S JUST DIFFERENT BUT EVEN EVEN ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF FUZZINESS
POD1000000048_S0000237 SO YOU KNOW AI SAFETY WASN'T VERY CRISPLY DEFINED A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT'S STARTING TO MOVE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF TECHNICAL RIGOR
POD1000000048_S0000238 AND I THINK THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO A POLICY TO SOME EXTENT BUT THERE WILL ALSO ALWAYS BE SOME ELEMENT OF RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND AND YOU KNOW QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS AND AND SO
POD1000000048_S0000239 OF THAT THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS SOLVING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SO YES I DO THINK THAT HAVING A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND WOULD IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT AREAS TO WORK BASED ON YOUR BACKGROUND
POD1000000048_S0000240 BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW WORKING ON THE SAFETY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY TECHNICAL AND THE POLICY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY NON TECHNICAL BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S SOME CORRELATION THERE
POD1000000048_S0000241 AND WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING DID YOU HAVE TO GET TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION
POD1000000048_S0000242 UM I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU NEED ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE A LOT OF ROLES THAT COULD BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST GOOD AT DISTILLING THE LITERATURE ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC
POD1000000048_S0000243 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE THAT A I COULD PLAY AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE
POD1000000048_S0000244 THEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ANY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO READ UP ON THE LITERATURE AROUND SURVEILLANCE AND COERCION AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT
POD1000000048_S0000245 SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR JUST GOOD SYNTHESIZERS AND AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CURIOUS AND INTERESTED TO DIP INTO AREAS THEY'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH
POD1000000048_S0000246 BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO A FAIRLY HIGH CEILING FOR A YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE YOU
POD1000000048_S0000247 ALSO I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH VERY STRONG TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS THINKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE THE NUDITY THE NITTY GRITTY GAME THEORY ISSUES RELATED TO ARMS RACES AND SO
POD1000000048_S0000248 SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S A PRETTY WHAT IT'S A PRETTY BROAD RANGE OF POSSIBLE SKILL SETS THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
POD1000000048_S0000249 RIGHT SINCE YOU'RE THINKING IF YOU CAN JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT EARLY YOU CAN SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT NAY I MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF DOING IN THE FUTURE AND THEN SAY IF YOU ARE NO ECONOMICS OR IF YOU KNOW SOCIAL
POD1000000048_S0000250 SO YOU CAN THINK WHAT IMPLICATIONS WOULD THAT HAVE FOR POLITICS AND THAT KIND OF THING EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SPECIFICALLY HOW THE HOW THEY I WOULD WORK
POD1000000048_S0000251 YEAH I MEAN IDEALLY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT EACH OF THOSE THINGS BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING
POD1000000048_S0000252 SO YOU IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY EVERY SINGLE DISCIPLINE OF WHICH ALL LISTS SEVERAL IN THIS POLICY CAREER GUIDE THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED
POD1000000048_S0000253 AND YOU KNOW CLEARLY YOU CANNOT BE AN EXPERT YOU KNOW A DEEP EXPERT AND TECHNICAL AI ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY POLITICAL SCIENCE ETC
POD1000000048_S0000254 BUT KNOWING A LITTLE BIT AND AND BEING ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE WITH COMPLEMENTARY SKILL SETS IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE
POD1000000048_S0000255 SO I THINK A LOT OF THE THE MOST EXCITING WORK IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL INVOLVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND ON THE POLICY SIDE
POD1000000048_S0000256 RIGHT SO HOW CAN SOMEONE TELL WHICH WHICH KIND OF PAUSE THAT ARE MOST SUITED FOR
POD1000000048_S0000258 I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY CLEAR ALGORITHM FOR THIS BUT TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND READING SOME OF THE LITERATURE AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE WHERE YOU THINK THE GAPS ARE
POD1000000048_S0000259 WHAT WHAT AREAS YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD SHED LIGHT ON GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO
POD1000000048_S0000260 YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT SORTS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW CASA FAIRLY BROAD NET BECAUSE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO STRIKE YOUR INTEREST UNTIL YOU STUMBLE UPON THAT OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000048_S0000261 AT NETWORKING IS ALSO SUPER HELPFUL SO I THINK YOU'RE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINDING OUT ABOUT JOB OR JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND FIGURING OUT WHERE THERE'S A NICE FIT BUT ALSO FINDING OUT ABOUT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES AND WHERE YOU MIGHT FIT IN IS ALSO USEFUL
POD1000000048_S0000262 SO YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SINGLE ALGORITHM BUT NETWORKING AND READING MORE OF THE LITERATURE OR N LOOKING AT JOB POSTINGS ARE ALL GOOD THINGS TO DO
POD1000000048_S0000263 YEAH WHAT KINDS OF PLACES CAN PEOPLE AND NETWORK THERE ARE THERE ANY EVENTS THAT ARE OPEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T YET HAVE ROLES
POD1000000048_S0000264 YEAH SO ALL OF THE AI CONFERENCES ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF PAYING PAYING FOR THE TRIP AND THE THE TICKET
POD1000000048_S0000265 SO SO SOME EXAMPLES OF BIG ARE AI CONFERENCES ARE NIPS ICML
POD1000000048_S0000267 AAA I AND SO FORTH
POD1000000048_S0000268 NIPS HAS YOU KNOW THE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING CONFERENCE RIGHT NOW WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DEEP LEARNING ICML IS ALSO A VERY LARGE ONE ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS BIGGER
POD1000000048_S0000269 I HAVEN'T BEEN ICML BUT I'VE BEEN TO NIPS A FEW TIMES AND I CLEAR I CLR IS ALSO A DEEP LEARNING SPECIFIC
POD1000000048_S0000270 SO I THINK GOING TO CONFERENCES LIKE THAT AND SPECIFICALLY GOING TO WORKSHOPS AND SYMPOSIA THAT ARE RELEVANT TO POLICY QUESTIONS WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS AT THESE CONFERENCES
POD1000000048_S0000271 SO FOR EXAMPLE IT NIPS LAST YEAR THERE WAS THERE'S A SYMPOSIUM ON AI AND THE LAW SO THERE
POD1000000048_S0000272 THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT NETWORK IN A FIND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE THINKING AND TO MEET PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS
POD1000000048_S0000273 AND THAT'S JUST ON THE AI SIDE THERE'S ALSO IT'S ALSO WORTH THINKING ABOUT MORE POLICY ORIENTED CONFERENCES SO THERE'S SOME CONFERENCES LIKE THE GOVERNANCE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE
POD1000000048_S0000274 THE WE ROBOT CONFERENCE SERIES AND PROBABLY A FEW OTHERS THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE WANT TO MOVE INTO MORE THINKING ABOUT POLICY SIDE
POD1000000048_S0000275 OR JUST THERE IN THE POLICY SIDE BUT THEY WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY SEEK OUT PEOPLE INTERESTED IN AI THOSE WOULD BE GOOD PLACES TO LOOK
POD1000000048_S0000276 HMM AND IRONY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED OPEN ENOUGH THAT SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE AREA I CAN DROP BY AND GET TO KNOW PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000277 YEAH SO I THINK PARTICULARLY ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE THOUGH YOU KNOW TO SOME EXTENT ALSO AT CORPORATIONS THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF OPENNESS
POD1000000048_S0000278 AND FOR EXAMPLE AT FHI WE HOST A LOT OF VISITORS WHO JUST WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR WORK AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
POD1000000048_S0000280 YEAH SO IT SOUNDED LIKE IN YOUR GUIDE HE THOUGHT THAT THE BEST UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR WAS SOMETHING LIKE COMBINING A TECHNICAL
POD1000000048_S0000281 LIKE MATH SO A COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH MORE SOCIAL SCIENCE TOPIC LIKE YOU KNOW POLITICS OR ECONOMICS
POD1000000048_S0000282 UM ASSUMING THAT MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS EVER HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN CHOSEN THEIR MAJOR WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL SHOULD THEY DO A PHD OR JUST GO AND WORK DIRECTLY AT GOOGLE IF THEY CAN
POD1000000048_S0000284 I
POD1000000048_S0000286 I MEAN I'VE PROBABLY SAID THIS A MILLION TIMES BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR AND YEAH THAT'S IT FOR EVERYONE BUT
POD1000000048_S0000288 BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE AN ADVANCED DEGREE THAT OF COURSE THEIR OPPORTUNITY COSTS BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A
POD1000000048_S0000289 SO FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A HARD REQUIREMENT CERTAINLY BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE APPLYING TO A FAIR NUMBER OF INDUSTRY JOBS IF THEY HAD AN ADVANCED DEGREE
POD1000000048_S0000290 UM AS WELL AS IN ACADEMIA SO I MEAN IT'S HARD TO AVOID THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW FOR ACADEMIC JOBS AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO HIRE PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON YOUR THEIR DEMONSTRATED SKILL IT'S
POD1000000048_S0000291 OFTEN ALSO THE CASE THAT THEIR UNIVERSITY POLICIES SURROUNDING WHAT SORTS OF DEGREES YOU NEED FOR DIFFERENT ROLES AND PAY GRADES AND SO FORTH SO
POD1000000048_S0000292 THERE'S DEFINITELY VALUE TO HAVING A GRADUATE DEGREE DESPITE THE YOU KNOW NON TRIVIAL OPPORTUNITY COSTS IF YOU HAVE AN
POD1000000048_S0000293 BUT AS WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS IT DEPENDS ON SOMEONE'S BACKGROUND AND IF YOU HAVE A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT
POD1000000048_S0000294 AND YOU COULD PERHAPS GET SOME OF THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BY ALSO TAKING CLASSES ONLINE OR ENROLLING AT A LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND BEING A PART TIME PHD STUDENT OR MASTERS STUDENT I THINK
POD1000000048_S0000295 YEAH YOU SHOULD YEAH THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON
POD1000000048_S0000296 YEAH AND I GUESS THE MOST OBVIOUS OPTIONS AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL THINGS LIKE MACHINE LEARNING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE OR ECONOMICS OR I GUESS PUBLIC POLICY IS THAT USEFUL
POD1000000048_S0000297 YEAH SO AT JUST TO GIVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE AT OXFORD WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN AI SAFETY AND AI POLICY AS WELL AS THE BROADER ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUTURE
POD1000000048_S0000298 AND YOU KNOW JUST AT THE ORGANIZATION THAT I'M AT FHI THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER CURRENTLY ENROLLED OR WILL SOON BE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS IN MIND WHICH IS HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
POD1000000048_S0000299 AS WELL AS MACHINE LEARNING CYBERSECURITY AND ZOOLOGY SO THERE THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE AREAS THAT ONE COULD STUDY AND FIND AN ADVISOR THAT IS SUITABLE AND INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING INTERESTING WORK
POD1000000048_S0000301 YEAH SO SOME PEOPLE WORRY THAT DOING WORK IN THIS IN THIS AREA COULD BE HARMFUL IF NOT DONE WELL FOR EXAMPLE IT COULD BE THAT AS YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER THAT REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD BE DONE POORLY AND WOULD ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL OVERALL
POD1000000048_S0000302 OR THAT BRINGING GREATER ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE COULD COULD REINFORCE THE THE ARMS RACE DYNAMIC OR ATTENTIVELY HAVING PEOPLE GET INVOLVED WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE COULD BRING THE AREA INTO DISREPUTE
POD1000000048_S0000303 HOW SERIOUSLY DO YOU TAKE THOSE KINDS OF CONCERNS SHOULD PEOPLE BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ABOUT JUMPING INTO THE AREA IF THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE REALLY ON TOP OF THINGS
POD1000000048_S0000304 UM I
POD1000000048_S0000306 I THINK THAT IT'S A REASONABLE CONCERN AND YEAH THERE IS
POD1000000048_S0000307 FACT SOME SOME RISK OF DISCREDITING YOURSELF OR OR YOUR CAUSED BY BY BEING YOU KNOW TO TO ALARMIST OR WHATEVER THE PARTICULAR CHARGE MIGHT BE
POD1000000048_S0000308 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE IN THE SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE NEAR TERM THERE WILL BE TERMINATOR PICTURES AND AND AND PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW DISMISS AI SAFETY AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL
POD1000000048_S0000309 SO I THINK THERE ARE ALSO RISKS OF NOT ACTING WHICH IS NOT NOT BEING ABLE TO HELP OUT WHEN THERE'S AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE
POD1000000048_S0000310 SAY IT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS YOU THEN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR BELIEFS AND WHAT THEIR BELIEFS ARE AND YOU KNOW
POD1000000048_S0000311 WHETHER THERE'S YOU KNOW HOW AND LOOK AT SURVEYS OF EXPERTS AND SEE SEE HOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE YOU KNOW REASONABLE DISTRIBUTION IS AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED THE TOPIC MORE
POD1000000048_S0000312 SO I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW AN ALL OR NOTHING SORT OF THING WHERE WE EITHER HAVE TO STAY IGNORANT OR YOU KNOW BE A SUPER EXPERT
POD1000000048_S0000313 I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE YOU SORT OF DEVELOP YOUR CONFIDENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE AS YOU GO AND TRY AND REMAIN AS MODEST AS POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE EXPERTISE
POD1000000048_S0000314 YES I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ALWAYS JUST TRACK THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR NICK BOSTROM ARE SAYING AND HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE SO THE SO YOU DON'T COME ACROSS AS ALARMIST AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A MEASURED AND HER PRECISE TONE
POD1000000048_S0000315 RIGHT RIGHT
POD1000000048_S0000316 YEAH SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THAT A I COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS AND THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THINGS COULD GO BADLY GIVEN THAT DID YOU SEE MUCH OF A LIE WHEN PEOPLE GOING INTO INTO MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE ROLES TO WITH THE HOPE OF LIMITING THIS IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000048_S0000318 POSSIBLY IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR ROLE SO PROBABLY A ROLE HIGHER UP IN THE CHAIN AND MORE ON THE POLICY AND STRATEGY SIDES OF THINGS
POD1000000048_S0000319 AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE OPERATIONAL OR LOGISTICAL OR EXECUTION SIDE OF THINGS WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFFECT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
POD1000000048_S0000320 BUT THERE MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFITS TO THAT BEYOND JUST HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ISSUE WHILE IN THAT
POD1000000048_S0000321 YOU CAN ALSO BENEFIT DEVELOP VALUABLE CONNECTIONS AND KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE DOWN THE ROAD OR HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROBLEM AND YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SOLVE IT SO
POD1000000048_S0000322 I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T DISMISS IT BUT I ALSO WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND IT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE BOARD AS THE BEST THING TO DO
POD1000000048_S0000323 YEAH I GUESS THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE MILITARY JUST SUCH AN ENORMOUS BUREAUCRACY IS I SUPPOSE I'D WORRY THAT SOMEONE LIKE IT'S JUST UNLIKELY PERHAPS THAT YOU'D BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR HAVE ENOUGH DISCRETION IN THOSE ROLES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
POD1000000048_S0000324 BUT AS YOU SAY IT COULD IT COULD HELP YOU TO BUILD UP YOUR CAREER CAPITAL SO YOU CAN GET OTHER GOOD USEFUL ROLES IN FUTURE AND YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS SO YOU CAN POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE IT FROM OUTSIDE AND TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000325 YEAH EXACTLY SO YOU KNOW AGAIN IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON AND WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH CONSIDERING
POD1000000048_S0000326 WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY COULD IT BE USEFUL TO GO INTO YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT SO IN DEPARTMENT OF STATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WORK ON ARMS CONTROL
POD1000000048_S0000327 SO EVEN JUST CURRENT ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENT SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK AND CAN THINK ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT WORK FOR AI IN FUTURE
POD1000000048_S0000329 YEAH SO I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY USEFUL LOOKING AT ARMS CONTROL AND FOREIGN POLICY BOTH FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A PRACTITIONER PERSPECTIVE I THINK IS VERY VALUABLE
POD1000000048_S0000330 AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT THAT'S NOT OUR STRONG SUIT IN THE AI SAFETY AND POLICY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW
POD1000000048_S0000331 SO MORE COULD BE DONE ON THAT FRONT BUT I THINK YOU HAVE SOME OF THE SAME CAVEATS APPLIED TO THE THE AS TO THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SIDE OF THINGS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE IS A VERY LARGE BUREAUCRACY
POD1000000048_S0000332 YEAH AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JUST MORE GENERAL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER SUCH THAT WHEN II IS DEVELOPED THINGS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO
POD1000000048_S0000333 FOR EXAMPLE JUST IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL TRAINING AND GET THE RIGHT KINDS OF PEOPLE ELECTED OR OR IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST THE FUTURE ACROSS THE
POD1000000048_S0000335 IT IS I GUESS ONE WAY WOULD BE THAT THAT'S JUST NOT SUFFICIENTLY LEVERAGED ON THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND IF YOU THINK AI IS REALLY LIKELY TO BE THE KEY ISSUE THEN YOU WANT TO WORK ON THAT SPECIFICALLY
POD1000000048_S0000336 BUT MAYBE IF YOU CAN IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN FUTURE ACROSS THE BOARD THEN THAT THAT COULD BE A BETTER OPTION AND ALSO YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OPEN TO BROADER WAYS OF IMPROVING THE WORLD
POD1000000048_S0000337 YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR DECISION FOR EVERYONE BUT IT BOTH AT THE GROUP LEVEL AND AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IT MIGHT OFTEN MAKE SENSE TO TAKE A SOMEWHAT OF A PORTFOLIO APPROACH
POD1000000048_S0000338 SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE AT FHI WHO ALSO AFFILIATED WITH THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM AND INVOLVED IN YOU KNOW BUILDING THE ATA COMMUNITY LIKE OH AND COTTON BARRETT AND TO BE ORDERED
POD1000000048_S0000339 SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STRADDLE THAT BOUNDARY AND AND LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT BOTH SIDES AND THEY'RE ALSO PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW WHO FOCUS ON ONE THING OR THE OTHER
POD1000000048_S0000340 SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR RIGHT ANSWER BUT CERTAINLY THE SORTS OF TRADE OFFS YOU MENTIONED SOUND REASONABLE LIKE ON THE ONE HAND ONE WOULD WANT THE WORLD TO BE IN A BETTER PLACE
POD1000000048_S0000341 FOR THERE TO BE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT MAKING MAKING GOOD DECISIONS AND BENEFITING THE FUTURE PEOPLE IN VARIOUS IMPORTANT DECISION MAKING ROLES
POD1000000048_S0000342 BUT THERE IT'S QUITE UNCERTAIN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IMPACT YOU COULD HAVE ON A I AND LIKEWISE EVEN EVEN IF YOU WORK DIRECTLY ON AI IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEST THING YOU SHOULD DO
POD1000000048_S0000343 BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A SLIGHT BIAS TOWARDS THINKING THAT WE'RE THAT DIRECT WORK IS NEEDS MORE ATTENTION AT THE MOMENT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
POD1000000048_S0000344 BECAUSE YEAH I WOULD LIKE MORE PEOPLE TO HELP SOLVE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS I'M WORKING ON
POD1000000048_S0000345 SO WE SHOULD POTENTIALLY CONTINUE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED SHIT I WILL JUST BECOME AN AI RESEARCHERS RIGHT AWAY
POD1000000048_S0000346 RIGHT
POD1000000048_S0000347 SO THAT'S A THAT'S ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD
POD1000000048_S0000348 ANY INSPIRING MESSAGE
POD1000000048_S0000349 YEAH I MEAN I'LL JUST SORT OF CIRCLE BACK ON WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER WHICH IS THAT AI SAFETY WAS IN A VERY NEBULOUS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT A FEW YEARS AGO
POD1000000048_S0000350 AND IT TOOK THE WORK OF NICK BOSTROM AND SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND STUART RUSSELL AND GIVING A LOT OF TALKS AND WRITING OP EDS TO CALL MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND GIVE IT MORE LEGITIMACY
POD1000000048_S0000351 AND THEN SUBSEQUENT WORK WAS DONE TO REFINE THE ISSUE AND DEVELOP RESEARCH AGENDAS BY PEOPLE INCLUDING THE AUTHORS OF THE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN AI SAFETY PAPER
POD1000000048_S0000352 AND NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF POSTDOCS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON THIS WE HAVE PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON WELL DEFINED PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE
POD1000000048_S0000353 AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SIMILAR TRANSITION IN AI POLICY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
POD1000000048_S0000354 TO REMOVE FROM FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL DESIDERATA AND AND PROBLEM FRAMINGS TO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND YOU KNOW FORMAL MODELS AND YOU KNOW GOOD WHITE PAPER
POD1000000048_S0000355 AND SO FORTH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE'S EXPERTISE SO I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WHO THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME RELEVANT EXPERTISE TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IT
POD1000000048_S0000356 YEAH I'LL JUST READ TO WRITE THAT SINCE I WROTE OUR PROBLEM PROFILE ON POSITIVELY SHAPING ARTIFICIAL DEVELOPMENT WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS IS THE THE MOST NEGLECTED AREA WITHIN WITHIN A I SAFETY
POD1000000048_S0000357 AND I'M VERY KEEN TO GET MORE PEOPLE WORKING ON THESE PROBLEMS AND GETTING MORE ORGANIZATIONS ARE HIRING FOR THEM SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
POD1000000048_S0000358 I THINK YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE LOOKING INTO IT MORE AND I WILL PUT UP A LINKS TO GUIDES WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE AND MAKE THE RIGHT PEOPLE
POD1000000048_S0000360 YEAH THANKS SO MUCH HAVE A GREAT DAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING IN
POD1000000048_S0000361 ALRIGHT THANKS BYE

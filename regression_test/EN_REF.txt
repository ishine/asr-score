POD1000000004_S0000026 BUT EVENTUALLY   GREEN FINISHED HER TRAINING AND GOT BACK TO A MORE REGULAR SCHEDULE   WHICH ALLOWED FOR GROCERY SHOPPING AND MEAL PREP   SO SHE CANCELED HER SUBSCRIPTION

POD1000000004_S0000041 WHEN BLUE APRON BEGAN IN TWENTY TWELVE   IT WAS SUPPOSED TO REVOLUTIONIZE HOW AMERICANS ATE   IT WAS GOING TO GENTLY PULL US AWAY FROM OUR TAKE OUT AND OUR T V DINNERS AND NUDGE US BACK INTO THE KITCHEN   AND FOR A WHILE   IT WORKED   UNTIL IT DIDN'T  
POD1000000004_S0000042 AND AMERICANS RETURNED TO THE WARM EMBRACE OF THEIR BOXED MAC AND CHEESE AND TAKEOUT PAD THAI   OBVIOUSLY   A HOME COOKING REVOLUTION DIDN'T MATERIALIZE  
POD1000000004_S0000043 OR DID IT   THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS HAS FORCED MANY OF US TO BECOME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR CASSEROLE DISHES AND OUR GARLIC PRESSES AND OUR DUTCH OVENS  
POD1000000004_S0000044 WE MADE BANANA BREAD BY THE PALLET AND SOURDOUGH STARTER BY THE TON   WE LEARNED HOW TO SEAR STEAKS AND SPATCHCOCK CHICKENS AND ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME CARNIVOROUS TECHNIQUES   IN SHORT   BOY DID WE EVER COOK  
POD1000000004_S0000045 ALL THIS COOKING AT HOME CREATED A MAKER BREAK MOMENT FOR BLUE APRON   BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT   JUST A FEW YEARS AGO   THE COMPANY WAS VALUED AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS   NOW IT WAS BARELY HANGING ON BY ITS FINGERNAILS  
POD1000000004_S0000046 IT'S ONLY LIFELINE A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS SO REQUIRED SO MANY OF US TO SHELTER IN PLACE FOR MONTHS AND AVOID TRIPS TO THE GROCERY STORE  
POD1000000004_S0000047 I'M LAUREN OBER AND FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA   WELCOME TO THE NEW SEASONS OF SPECTACULAR FAILURES   THE SHOW THAT ALWAYS FLAMBEES THE HELL OUT OF FAILURE  
POD1000000004_S0000049 LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE IDEA FOR BLUE APRON BEGAN WITH AN ARGENTINIAN STEAK   THERE WERE THESE TWO GUYS   MATT SALZBERG AND ILIA PAPAS   THEY WERE CLEVER TECH ENTREPRENEUR TYPES  
POD1000000004_S0000050 FULL OF IDEAS   SALZBERG HAD AN M B A FROM HARVARD AND CUT HIS TEETH IN A BIG NEW YORK VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM   PAPAS WAS A GO GETTER SOFTWARE ENGINEER   THEY MET AT A NETWORK Y HAPPY HOUR AND DECIDED TO GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER  
POD1000000004_S0000051 BUT WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS  
POD1000000004_S0000052 THEIR ORIGINAL IDEA IS NOT MEAL KITS   IT IS MORE OF A RESEARCH CROWD FUNDING IDEA CALLED PETRI DISH  
POD1000000004_S0000053 THAT'S ALEX KONRAD   HE'S A SENIOR EDITOR AT FORBES   HE WROTE ABOUT THE FOUNDERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN   PETRI DISH WASN'T THE PAIR'S ONLY STARTUP IDEA  
POD1000000004_S0000054 I THINK ANOTHER ONE WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ARTICLE WAS   WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS  
POD1000000004_S0000055 I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND  
POD1000000004_S0000057 A HIGH END BUT ALSO AFFORDABLE STROLLER EXPERIENCE   UM   YEAH  
POD1000000004_S0000058 SO THOSE TWO STARTUP IDEAS   A KICKSTARTER FOR SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS AND A WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS   WERE NONSTARTERS FOR THE PAIR   BUT THEN OVER GRILLED MEAT   IT HIT THEM  
POD1000000004_S0000059 SALZBERG AND PAPAS ARE DOING DINNER   AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO AH MAKE ARGENTINIAN AH STEAKS ON A BORROWED GRILL  
POD1000000004_S0000060 AND THEY'RE LIKE   YOU KNOW   WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE'S A SERVICE BASICALLY   FOR AMATEURS LIKE US  
POD1000000004_S0000061 IN FACT   THERE WAS   BUT IT WAS IN SWEDEN   IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN   A WOMAN NAMED KICKI THEANDER CREATED A COMPANY CALLED  
POD1000000004_S0000062 MIDDAGSFRID   THAT TRANSLATES INTO DINNER PEACE IN ENGLISH  
POD1000000004_S0000063 LET ME SEE IF I CAN PRONOUNCE THIS RIGHT   MIDDAGSFRID  
POD1000000004_S0000064 DA   THAT'S PRETTY GOOD  
POD1000000004_S0000065 THEANDER WANTED TO SOLVE THE VEXING NIGHTLY PROBLEM THAT FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD FACE   WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER   BECAUSE THE ANSWER CAN'T ALWAYS BE ICE CREAM  
POD1000000004_S0000066 PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HELL HOUR   HUM YOU KNOW   LIKE THE HOUR BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN TO THE GROCERY STORE AND AH FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE ABOUT WHO'S COOKING TONIGHT   WHAT ARE WE HAVING  
POD1000000004_S0000067 THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
POD1000000004_S0000068 I THINK THE QUESTION IS   THEN   IS THIS A LEGITIMATELY HUGE PROBLEM   AND IS THIS A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD AS WELL  
POD1000000004_S0000069 FOR SALZBERG AND PAPAS   THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES   NOW   AT THIS POINT   IT WAS TWENTY TWELVE   AND THEANDER'S COMPANY HAD BEEN AROUND FOR FIVE YEARS AND WAS GROWING STEADILY  
POD1000000004_S0000070 IT HAD A FEW COMPETITORS IN EUROPE   BUT IN THE U S   NOTHING OF THE SORT EXISTED   WHICH WAS GREAT FOR SALZBERG AND PAPAS  
POD1000000004_S0000071 AND SO THEY THINK   HEY   WE CAN START OUR OWN MEAL KIT COMPANY FOR THE U S MARKET CALLED PART AND PARSLEY  
POD1000000004_S0000072 TO BE CLEAR   THAT'S A TERRIBLE NAME   AND VERY QUICKLY THEY CHANGED IT TO BLUE APRON   NAMED FOR WHAT FRENCH APPRENTICE CHEFS WEAR IN THE KITCHEN  
POD1000000004_S0000073 AT ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TIME   A HARVARD CLASSMATE OF SALZBERG'S BEGAN A RIVAL MEAL KIT COMPANY CALLED PLATED   BUT SALZBERG AND PAPAS WEREN'T WORRIED   BECAUSE THEY HAD BROUGHT ON A RINGER  
POD1000000004_S0000074 MATT WADIAK   A CHEF WITH A DEGREE FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA   AND WADIAK WAS THE GUY THAT WAS GONNA MAKE THEIR BUSINESS STAND APART FROM ITS RIVALS  
POD1000000004_S0000075 WADIAK WOULD BASICALLY GO AND SOURCE THE INGREDIENTS   FARMERS WOULD SAY   OKAY   WE WOULD LOVE TO LOCK IN THESE LARGE EXTRA ORDERS  
POD1000000004_S0000076 AT A SCALE THAT IS VERY UM ATTRACTIVE TO US   YOU KNOW   MANY THOUSANDS OF INGREDIENTS   I THINK YOU KNOW   WHEN HE WAS IN HIS FOOD WORLD THAT WAS A DIFFERENTIATOR AND GREAT FOR BLUE APRON  
POD1000000004_S0000077 NOT ONLY DID WADIAK DESIGN THE MENUS AND SOURCE THE PRODUCTS   BUT HE ALSO SERVED AS HIS SOCIAL MEDIA FACE OF THE COMPANY   HE WAS BLUE APRON'S CULINARY SECRET WEAPON AND DID A SERIES OF EARLY YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWCASING HIS KNOW HOW  
POD1000000004_S0000078 HERE HE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT ARTICHOKES AREN'T VILE  
POD1000000004_S0000079 EVERYBODY LIKES ARTICHOKES BUT THEY'RE CRAZY   WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM   THEY'RE TOUGH   THEY'RE SPINY   THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE   THEY'RE KIND OF CONFUSING   A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T COOK THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO COOK THEM SO  
POD1000000004_S0000081 HE CUTS INTO SOME TRULY REVOLTING ARTICHOKES AND PROCEEDS TO MAKE MY WORST DINING NIGHTMARE  
POD1000000004_S0000082 GET IN THERE WITH A SPOON AND SCOOP OUT THAT REALLY HAIRY   CHOKEY INTERIOR   AND THE REASON WHY THEY CALL IT THE CHOKE IS BECAUSE IF YOU EAT THIS   YOU ARE GONNA CHOKE   IT'S FULL OF LITTLE FIBERS AND IT'S LIKE A FISH BONE  
POD1000000004_S0000083 IN THE EARLY DAYS   ALL THE FOUNDERS HAD TO HUSTLE LIKE THIS   BEFORE THEY HAD STAFF   IT WAS SALZBERG   PAPAS AND WADIAK PACKING UP BOXES IN A SMALL KITCHEN IN LONG ISLAND CITY   NEW YORK  
POD1000000004_S0000084 THEN SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE   THE COMPANY LANDED SOME SWEET VENTURE CAPITAL TO THE TUNE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS   THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD FOR THE STARTUP  
POD1000000004_S0000085 WITHIN THE FIRST FEW YEARS   THE BUSINESS TOOK OFF   IN TWENTY FOURTEEN   BLUE APRON WAS SHIPPING SIX HUNDRED THOUSANDS MEALS A MONTH   BY TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS EIGHT MILLION MEALS   AND A BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE  
POD1000000004_S0000086 WITHIN JUST FIVE YEARS OF ITS FOUNDING   THE COMPANY EMPLOYED FORTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND WAS VALUED AT NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS   BLUE APRON LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ON THE EXPRESS TRAIN TO SUCCESSVILLE  
POD1000000004_S0000087 BLUE APRON SEEMED TO BE SORT OF THE BUZZIEST   THE BIGGEST MARKET SHARE   THE LEADER IN THIS EMERGING CATEGORY  
POD1000000004_S0000088 WHICH INCLUDED HELLOFRESH   SUNBASKET AND ABOUT A MILLION COMPANIES WITH THE WORD CHEF IN THE NAME  
POD1000000004_S0000089 THEN   I ACTUALLY TRIED THE PRODUCTS   AND IT SEEMED   AT LEAST TO ME PERSONALLY   JUST AS SOMEONE UM   TESTING THE PRODUCTS   THAT BLUE APRON OVERALL KIND OF HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT RESONATED THE MOST WITH ME   AND I THOUGHT MIGHT RESONATE THE MOST WITH AMERICANS  
POD1000000004_S0000090 NOW   THE THING ABOUT AMERICANS IS  
POD1000000004_S0000091 WE LOVE PRODUCTS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER   MORE CONVENIENT   LESS OF A HASSLE   AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BLUE APRON WAS DOING   IT WAS SAYING   HEY   WORKING MOM   WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT IN YOUR PLATE L O L  
POD1000000004_S0000092 WE WANT TO HELP YOU COOK NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS MEALS FOR YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF GOING TO THE GROCERY STORY OR READING A COOKBOOK  
POD1000000004_S0000093 BUT IT WAS ALSO SAYING   HEY   MILLENNIAL   WE KNOW YOU'RE A WORK HARD   PLAY HARD   EAT SLOPPY TAKEOUT AT NINE P M KIND OF PERSON   BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'D LOVE TO COOK IF ONLY IT WASN'T SUCH A TIME CONSUMING PAIN IN THE ASS  
POD1000000004_S0000094 SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SUPER CONVENIENT FOR YOU  
POD1000000004_S0000096 THIS AMERICAN OBSESSION WITH CONVENIENCE AROUND FOOD   AND IN PARTICULAR THE MAGICAL HOME COOKED MEAL MINUS THE EFFORT   GOES BACK TO AT LEAST TO THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY   SAYS CULINARY HISTORIAN LAURA SHAPIRO  
POD1000000004_S0000097 THAT WAS WHEN A PARTICULAR BRAND OF UTOPIAN FICTION BEGAN TO EMERGE  
POD1000000004_S0000098 THE PLOT WAS SORT OF THE SAME   SOMEBODY IS TAKING A WALK   THEY GET BONKED ON THE HEAD   WHEN THEY WAKE UP   IT'S FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE FUTURE   AND THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE STRANGE LOOKING CREATURES AND IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD  
POD1000000004_S0000099 AND SOMEBODY TAKES THEM TO DINNER   THEY TAKE THEM HOME TO DINNER   AND IT'S A MIRACLE DINNER  
POD1000000004_S0000100 THE FOOD JUST APPEARED WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON OR THE WAVE OF AN ARM   AND IT WAS SCRUMPTIOUS AND FILLING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BACK THEN   DIGESTIBLE  
POD1000000004_S0000101 MIRACLE FOOD   IT WAS UTOPIAN FOOD   AND THAT HAS BEEN A DREAM   I THINK THAT IS ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE AMERICAN DINNER TABLE FOR DECADES AND DECADES  
POD1000000004_S0000102 NOT LONG AFTER THE EMERGENCE OF THIS UTOPIAN FICTION   DINNING ACTUALLY DID START TO LOOK LIKE A MIRACLE   YOU COULD BUY VEGETABLES IN A CAN AND CHICKEN IN A CAN AND LATER FULL MEALS LIKE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS IN A CAN  
POD1000000004_S0000103 THEN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CAME THE FROZEN TURKEY DINNER   JUST WHACK IT IN THE OVEN AND PRESTO   A RUBBERY SIMULACRUM OF THE REAL THING   BUT IT WAS QUICK   AND CLEAN UP WAS A BREEZE  
POD1000000004_S0000104 MOTHER MURPHY   LUCKY ME   MY WIFE USES SWANSON T V TURKEY DINNERS   AND MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LUCKY TOO   GET SWANSON T V TURKEY DINNERS   SWANSON T V FRIED CHICKEN DINNERS  
POD1000000004_S0000105 SWANSON T V BEEF DINNERS FROM YOUR GROCER'S BIG FREEZER  
POD1000000004_S0000106 WHEN FROZEN FISH STICKS HIT THE SCENE AROUND THE SAME TIME   OH BUDDY   IT WAS UTOPIAN FICTION COME TO LIFE  
POD1000000004_S0000107 MASTER CHAD MORLEY ATE MRS   PAUL'S FISH STICKS WITH HIS FINGERS  
POD1000000004_S0000108 NOW I'M THIRTY TWO AND I USE A FORK   SOMETIMES  
POD1000000004_S0000109 MRS   PAUL'S FISH STICKS   YOU'LL NEVER STOP LOVING THEM  
POD1000000004_S0000110 IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS   THESE YOU KNOW   DEEP FRIED FROZEN FISH STICKS THAT TASTED NOT AT ALL OF FISH   WHICH MEANT THAT AH   THAT PEOPLE ADORED THEM  
POD1000000004_S0000111 OBVIOUSLY FISH STICKS TOOK OFF AND THE INDUSTRY USED THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO STICKILY EVERYTHING   CHICKEN   EGGPLANT   LIMA BEANS   WHATEVER YOU COULD DEEP FRY AND FREEZE   THE PACKAGED FOOD INDUSTRY TRIED IT  
POD1000000004_S0000112 THE POST WAR YEARS ALSO BROUGHT AN EXPLOSION OF FAST FOOD AND TAKEOUT MEALS   AND NOW THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY   WE CAN ORDER JUST ABOUT ANY FOOD WE WANT   FROM SOME VEGAN DRUMSTICKS TO A PRIX FIXE HAUTE CUISINE MEAL   JUST BY PRESSING AN APP  
POD1000000004_S0000113 ALL OF THESE ITERATIONS OF THE MIRACLE DINNER   IT'S LIKE THEY AIM AT THREE LONGINGS THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT MAKING DINNER   THEY WANT IT TO BE EFFORTLESS  
POD1000000004_S0000114 THEY WANT IT TO BE DELICIOUS   AND THEY WANT IT TO HAVE THE MORAL VALUE OF HOME COOKING  
POD1000000004_S0000115 THE HOME COOKING ASPECT OF THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST RESONANT  
POD1000000004_S0000116 THE THING THAT HOME COOKING DELIVERS THAT NONE OF THESE OTHER THINGS DO IS THAT IT SATISFIES   I THINK   WHAT WE ALL FEEL AS THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO COOK  
POD1000000004_S0000117 THERE'S SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T CLICK IN WHEN THE THING COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE  
POD1000000004_S0000118 AND THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR A COMPANY LIKE BLUE APRON BECAUSE  
POD1000000004_S0000119 BLUE APRON   INCHES A LITTLE CLOSER TO THAT   IT   IT JUST IT GETS YOU THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FEELING AS THOUGH YOU HAVE COOKED TO THIS  
POD1000000004_S0000120 NOTICE SHAPIRO SAID FEELING AS THOUGH YOU COOKED SOMETHING   BECAUSE FOR HER   WHAT BLUE APRON IS DOING   DESPITE ALL OF ITS FRESH INGREDIENTS AND CHEF INSPIRED RECIPES   IS HELPING YOU ASSEMBLE  
POD1000000004_S0000121 THEY KIND OF FOOL YOU INTO THINKING YOU'RE COOKING   WHERE IS REAL COOKING   HANDS ON COOKING   KNOWLEDGEABLE COOKING   HAS TO DO WITH COOKING DAY AFTER DAY  
POD1000000004_S0000122 DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE MAKING FABULOUS   ELABORATE MEALS DAY AFTER DAY   EVEN IF IT'S THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE THING   THAT'S COOKING  
POD1000000004_S0000123 SURE   GETTING A DIME BAG OF ZA'ATAR   A THIMBLEFUL OF PEPITAS AND A LITERAL TABLESPOON OF SESAME OIL IN YOUR MEAL KIT DOES HAVE A SOMEWHAT INFANTILIZING EFFECT  
POD1000000004_S0000124 BUT IN BLUE APRON'S EARLY YEARS   PLENTY OF PEOPLE WERE HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYTHING PORTIONED OUT FOR THEM   BUT CONVINCING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WANTED AND NEEDED A SERVICE LIKE THAT   THAT COST THE COMPANY SOME BIG CASH  
POD1000000004_S0000125 IN THE FORM OF FREE MEALS   TONS OF SPECIALS AND ENDLESS ADVERTISING   ANYONE WHO LISTENED TO PODCASTS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS BOUND TO HAVE HEARD AT LEAST ONE DISINTERESTED PODCAST HOST GIVE A LACKLUSTER BLUE APRON AD READ  
POD1000000004_S0000127 IN BIZ SPEAK ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN AS THE CAC   OR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST  
POD1000000004_S0000128 WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY SPENT  
POD1000000004_S0000129 ON MARKETING TO ACQUIRE CUSTOMERS   DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY ACTUALLY ACQUIRED  
POD1000000004_S0000130 THAT'S DAN MCCARTHY   HE'S THE MARKETING PROFESSOR AT EMORY UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS SCHOOL AND HE'S STUDIED BLUE APRON FOR YEARS   MCCARTHY SAYS THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS   BLUE APRON WAS SPENDING ABOUT SIXTY   SEVENTY DOLLARS PER CUSTOMER  
POD1000000004_S0000131 BUT THEN   AS PEOPLE CAME AND WENT   BLUE APRON HAD TO SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS ON BOARD   THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST JUST KEPT CREEPING UP AND UP AND UP UNTIL IT NEARLY DOUBLED  
POD1000000004_S0000132 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED TWENTY JUST TO BRING SOMEBODY IN   AH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT THAT YOU NEED AFTER THAT TO TO BREAK EVEN ON THAT CUSTOMER   THAT'S A TOUGHER PROPOSITION  
POD1000000004_S0000133 THE MORE MONEY BLUE APRON SPENT   THE HARDER IT WAS TO RECOUP THE INVESTMENT   WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND PROBLEM   PREVENTING CUSTOMERS FROM BOLTING ONCE THE COMPANY HAS SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TO BRING THEM IN  
POD1000000004_S0000134 HOW MANY CUSTOMERS STICK AROUND IS MEASURED BY A REALLY IMPORTANT METRIC CALLED CHURN RATE   THE CHURN RATE TELLS YOU THE RATE AT WHICH CUSTOMERS COME INTO AND SPIN OUT OF THE BUSINESS  
POD1000000004_S0000135 IF YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF CASH TO LAND NEW CUSTOMERS AND THEY DON'T STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF THEM   YOU HAVE HIGH CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS AND A HIGH CHURN RATE  
POD1000000004_S0000136 THAT'S WHERE BLUE APRON FOUND ITSELF   AND EVEN THE MOST BASIC COOKING DODO COULD TELL YOU THAT'S A GOURMET RECIPE FOR LOSING A LOT OF MONEY  
POD1000000004_S0000137 OUR PAL DR   GREEN USED BLUE APRON FOR ABOUT A YEAR   WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN MOST OF ITS CUSTOMERS STUCK AROUND  
POD1000000004_S0000138 YES   ABOUT HALF THE PEOPLE WERE CHURNING OUT IN A MONTH   BY SIX MONTHS   ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WERE CHURNING OUT   THEY JUST WEREN'T WEREN'T ABLE TO KEEP THOSE CUSTOMERS FOR AS LONG AS THEY THEY SHOULD  
POD1000000004_S0000139 DESPITE BLUE APRON'S EARLY SUCCESS AND GROWTH   ONE NUT THE COMPANY'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CRACK IS HOW TO STOP THAT OUTFLOW   HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO SUBSCRIBE AND STAY SUBSCRIBED   AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF THEM   IT'S A PUZZLE  
POD1000000004_S0000140 BUT DESPITE ITS HIGH CHURN RATE   BLUE APRON WAS STILL THE MARKET LEADER   IT HAD GOTTEN A SLIGHT JUMPSTART ON RIVAL HELLOFRESH AND IT WAS STARTING TO LOOK A REAL SEXY TO BIG INVESTORS  
POD1000000004_S0000141 THEY WERE THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLAS   AND EVEN THOUGH THE SPACE ITSELF WASN'T THAT THAT LARGE AT THE TIME   IT WAS STILL SOMETHING LIKE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS   AND   GROWING REALLY QUICKLY  
POD1000000004_S0000142 ON ITS FACE   BUSINESS SEEMED BOOMING   BUT THE WHOLE MEAL KIT MARKET WAS ON THE CUSP OF A SHAKE UP

POD1000000004_S0000166 NO STORY ABOUT BLUE APRON COULD BE CALLED COMPLETE WITHOUT SAMPLING THE PRODUCT   SO I ORDERED UP A BOX   AND PAID FOR IT   MIND YOU  
POD1000000004_S0000167 OKAY   SO I JUST GOT MY BLUE APRON BOX AT MY DOORSTEP   AND WHEN I PICKED IT UP   I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW HEAVY IT WAS  
POD1000000004_S0000168 WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED   IT FELT LIKE CHRISTMAS   EXCEPT BETTER BECAUSE THE FOOD WASN'T MEDIOCRE AND ARRANGED IN A SHRINK WRAPPED BASKET  
POD1000000004_S0000169 SO   LET'S CRACK INTO THIS BOX  
POD1000000004_S0000170 INSIDE THERE WERE TWO BUNCHES OF KALES   SOME LOOSE ONIONS AND ABOUT A MILLION TINY BAGGIES OF NICK NACKS   INCLUDING TWO TABLESPOONS OF CREME FRAICHE   A QUARTER OF A CUP OF PANKO BREADCRUMBS AND ONE TEASPOON OF SOMETHING CALLED FURIKAKE  
POD1000000004_S0000171 WHICH ACCORDING TO THE BLUE APRON RECIPE WAS SUPPOSED TO QUOTE LEND EVEN MORE SAVORY FLAVOR TO MY DISH   YUM  
POD1000000004_S0000173 THERE'S THE TINIEST   THE TINIEST   TINIEST PORTION OF BROWN RICE   I MEAN   THIS MUST BE MAYBE HALF A CUP   IN A BAG MAYBE THREE TIMES THE SIZE  
POD1000000004_S0000174 I DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE SAD TO COOK THESE DISHES BY MYSELF   SO I INVITED MY GIRLFRIEND OVER TO EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC OF BLUE APRON WITH ME  
POD1000000004_S0000175 YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN MEALS TONIGHT  
POD1000000004_S0000176 I'M SO READY   MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M SO HUNGRY  
POD1000000004_S0000177 OH   WELL   WE HAD THE CHOICE OF THREE DISHES   BUT ONE OF THEM HAD CILANTRO SAUCE   SO NO THANK YOU   ANOTHER WAS LIKE A SPICY INDIAN SITUATION AND I WAS FEELING KIND OF BASIC   SO I CHOSE THE PESTO AND KALE PASTA WITH GOAT CHEESE  
POD1000000004_S0000178 IT SAYS THIS QUICK COOKING PASTA GETS A ONE TWO PUNCH OF IRRESISTIBLE FLAVOR FROM A DOLLOP OF CREAMY GOAT CHEESE FOR DELICIOUS TANG AND OUR HERBACEOUS BASIL PESTO STIRRED INTO THE WARM PASTA AND GARLICKY KALE JUST BEFORE SERVING  
POD1000000004_S0000179 BY THE WAY   THAT WAS A WRONG  
POD1000000004_S0000180 HERBACEOUS  
POD1000000004_S0000181 A TOUCH OF CRUSHED RED PEPPER  
POD1000000004_S0000182 TECHNICALLY   WE PICKED THE EASIEST DISH   SO WHAT   THINGS WERE GOING WELL UNTIL I DROPPED A GARLIC CLOVE DOWN THE INSINKERATOR  
POD1000000004_S0000183 OH   HANNA NO   GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL  
POD1000000004_S0000184 AFTER THAT NEAR CATASTROPHE   WE BOILED THE FRESH CAVATELLI   SAUTEED THE KALE WITH GARLIC AND RED PEPPER FLAKES   ADDED THE PESTO AND THE DOLLOP OF GOAT CHEESE AND VOILA  
POD1000000004_S0000185 CAN I GET YOU A BOWL OF PASTA  
POD1000000004_S0000186 WHAT   WHY   YES  
POD1000000004_S0000187 YOU COULD  
POD1000000004_S0000188 AND I'M HERE TO REPORT   WE MADE A DAMN FINE MEAL   THE KALE WAS TENDER   CRISP AND VERY WELL SEASONED   THE CAVATELLI WAS PERFECTLY AL DENTE   WELL DONE   HANNA   AND THE CHEESE ADDED SOME GOOD SALTINESS  
POD1000000004_S0000189 I WOULD SAY WE WERE PERFECTLY SATISFIED DINERS   BUT WAIT   THERE IS MORE  
POD1000000004_S0000190 CLEANUP IS PRACTICALLY NOTHING   BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAME OUT OF A PACKET   SO REALLY   WE'RE ONLY LEFT WITH  
POD1000000004_S0000191 ACTUALLY THAT'S REALLY NICE  
POD1000000004_S0000192 A COUPLE OF DISHES  
POD1000000004_S0000193 I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THAT   I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE  
POD1000000004_S0000194 BUT NOT EVERYONE WHO'S USED BLUE APRON HAS APPRECIATED THAT   THE COMPANY HAS GOTTEN FLAK FOR ITS ABUNDANT PACKAGING   THOUGH MUCH OF IT IS NOW RECYCLABLE   AND CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE RECIPES WERE TOO COMPLICATED  
POD1000000004_S0000195 I MADE FOUR BLUE APRON MEALS FOR THIS STORY AND FOR A MIDDLING COOK WITH A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF COOKWARE   I THOUGHT THE DISHES WERE PRETTY SIMPLE TO ASSEMBLE   ALSO PRETTY TASTY  
POD1000000004_S0000196 I WOULD MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DISHES AGAIN   BUT I DO THE SHOPPING MYSELF   WHICH I GUESS SORT OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE  
POD1000000004_S0000197 WHEN I OPENED MY FIRST BLUE APRON BOX   IT WAS A NOVELTY   A CORNUCOPIA AND CARDBOARD   BUT   THEN I FORGOT TO CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION AND I GOT A SECOND BOX BY ACCIDENT  
POD1000000004_S0000198 THAT ONE WASN'T AS EXCITING   BY THEN   I UNDERSTOOD THE GIMMICK AND THE EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERY KIND OF FIZZLED   IN THIS WAY I'M NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TRY BLUE APRON   SAYS PROFESSOR DAN MCCARTHY  
POD1000000004_S0000199 DISCOVERY DOESN'T TEND TO LAST THAT LONG   THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE   THEY LOOK AT BLUE APRON AS THIS   IT'S LIKE   I WANT KIND OF THIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT EVERY MONTH  
POD1000000004_S0000200 AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY MAY WANT THAT INITIALLY   BUT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED A FEW TIMES YOU SAY   YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY GOOD   I I DON'T NEED ANY MORE OF THIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT  
POD1000000004_S0000201 BUT BLUE APRON EXECS WERE LIKE   AH YEAH YOU DO   YOU NEED IT AND YOU WANT IT   AND THEY BELIEVED IN THEIR PRODUCT'S ABILITY NOT JUST TO CONTINUALLY DELIGHT   BUT DO ACTUALLY PROVIDE A VALUABLE SERVICE TO PEOPLE  
POD1000000004_S0000202 AND ALL THAT MEANT THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN   THE COMPANY HAD TO WORK OUT ITS OPTIONS   PACK IT IN   SELL OR GO PUBLIC  
POD1000000004_S0000203 AND THE HIGHER UPS DECIDED ON GOING PUBLIC  
POD1000000004_S0000204 NOW   BEFORE OFFERING UP PUBLIC STOCK IN THE COMPANY FOR THE FIRST TIME   BLUE APRON WANTED TO SHOW STRONG CUSTOMER GROWTH   SO THEY STARTED TO AMP UP SPENDING TO BRING IN NEW USERS  
POD1000000004_S0000205 REMEMBER   CAC   THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST   IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE I P O   BLUE APRON INCREASED ITS MARKETING CASH BY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PERCENT  
POD1000000004_S0000206 BUT NONE OF THIS MARKETING RESULTED IN A HUGE NEW CUSTOMER HAUL   AND THAT   SAYS FORBES'S ALEX KONRAD   MADE INVESTORS A LITTLE LESS IN LOVE WITH THE COMPANY  
POD1000000004_S0000207 IT WAS HARD TO MAKE A REALLY ATTRACTIVE   YOU KNOW   FUTURE FACING STORY FOR LIKE HOW BLUE APRON REALLY BECOMES THAT HUGE  
POD1000000004_S0000208 BLUE APRON'S BOOKS WEREN'T THE ONLY THING THAT MADE INVESTORS TURN UP THEIR NOSES AROUND THE I P O   A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE BLUE APRON TEAM WAS SET TO RING THE BELL FOR NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE   AMAZON MADE A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT  
POD1000000004_S0000209 IT WAS BUYING WHOLE FOODS IN A THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEAL   FOR BLUE APRON   IT WAS LIKE GETTING UPSTAGED AT YOUR OWN WEDDING BY AN IMPOSSIBLY RICH AND INFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL GUEST OF A GUEST  
POD1000000004_S0000210 WHEN AMAZON'S ACQUISITION OF WHOLE FOODS WAS ANNOUNCED THAT WAS JUST DEVASTATING   UM EVEN JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT FELT LIKE   UM YOU KNOW   HERE COME THE GIANTS  
POD1000000004_S0000211 AND IF AMAZON CAN SELL THINGS TOO ONLINE REALLY WELL   AND WHOLE FOODS HAS PRETTY GOOD INGREDIENTS   WHAT IS BLUE APRON REALLY SELLING HERE  
POD1000000004_S0000212 AND THEN OF COURSE AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS OWN MEAL KIT OFFERING  
POD1000000004_S0000213 EVERYONE WAS AH VERY CONCERNED THAT AND BASICALLY THIS WAS GONNA BE THE NEXT YOU KNOW   I I WON'T CALL BLUE APRON END YOU KNOW   BUT I WOULD SAY EVERYONE AGREES AMAZON'S WAY BIGGER   SO  
POD1000000004_S0000215 THEY'RE JUST GONNA BOLD THEIR WAY RIGHT IN AND AND STAMP THIS THIS INDUSTRY OUT   AND SO THAT   THAT WAS A BIG LURKING CONCERN  
POD1000000004_S0000216 BLUE APRON'S I P O IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN RAISED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS   ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED   STOCK WENT FOR ABOUT TEN DOLLARS A SHARE RATHER THAN THE EXPECTED FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS  
POD1000000004_S0000217 IT WAS A TURBULENT UM I P O   TO SAY THE LEAST  
POD1000000004_S0000218 SOON   BLUE APRON CO FOUNDER AND C E O MATT SALZBERG SEEMED PRETTY UPBEAT ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION ON C N B C  
POD1000000004_S0000219 I'M HONESTLY NOT HERE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE PRICING OF BLUE APRON STOCK   THAT'S REALLY UP TO THE INVESTORS TO DECIDE   YOU KNOW   BLUE APRON IS HERE BECAUSE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER  
POD1000000004_S0000220 WE'RE TACKLING A HUGE MARKET AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM QUITE FRANKLY   AND THE STOCK PRICE TODAY   WHETHER IT'S UP   DOWN   LEFT   OR RIGHT IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEW CHAPTER IN OUR COMPANY'S LIFE THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT  
POD1000000004_S0000222 ONE THING SALZBERG MENTIONED IN THAT CLIP WAS HOW HIS COMPANY WAS TACKLING A HUGE MARKET   NOW IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE MARKET AS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO EAT FOOD IN AMERICA   THEN YEAH   THAT'S A HUGE MARKET  
POD1000000004_S0000223 BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOOD FOLKS AT MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY PACKAGED FACTS   THAT MARKET HAS A CEILING   AND NOT LIKE A CATHEDRAL CEILING  
POD1000000004_S0000224 INITIALLY   THE MARKET WAS DEFINITELY EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE INTEREST INITIALLY CAME FROM   IF YOU'RE SEEING THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING A HUNDRED PERCENT GROWTH LIKE THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT  
POD1000000004_S0000225 THAT'S CARA RASCH   SHE'S A FOOD AND BEVERAGE ANALYST WITH PACKAGED FACTS  
POD1000000004_S0000226 ONE OF THE WHOLE THINGS THAT I THINK WENT WRONG WITH THE INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS A VERY BIG ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS   BUT AS IT TURNS OUT   THERE REALLY ISN'T  
POD1000000004_S0000227 IT'S HARD TO GAUGE   BUT RASCH ESTIMATES THAT ONLY ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE U S POPULATION USES HOME DELIVERY MEAL KITS   AND SHE SAYS THE MARKET KIND OF PEAKED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO  
POD1000000004_S0000228 SINCE BLUE APRON STARTED   MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MEAL KIT SERVICES HAVE COME ON THE SCENE   BUT ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ARE NATIONAL OPERATIONS   WITH HELLOFRESH NOW THE CLEAR MARKET LEADER  
POD1000000004_S0000229 REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS MEAL KIT BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN   RASCH SAYS THE COMPANY NEVER DID MUCH WITH IT   AND THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR THAT MEAL KIT DELIVERY IS NOT A GROWING GLOBAL CONCERN  
POD1000000004_S0000230 I THINK THAT AMAZON SAW THAT MUCH OF THE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS HAD ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE COMPETITORS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE   SO THEY DIDN'T TRY REALLY TO BREAK INTO THAT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE MUCH POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH ANYMORE  
POD1000000004_S0000231 IT SEEMS LIKE AMAZON WAS RIGHT TO HOLD OFF   IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN   BLUE APRON HEMORRHAGED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS   AND ITS STOCK PRICE HAD TANKED JUST TWO DOLLARS AND NIGHT NINE CENTS A SHARE BY THE END OF THE YEAR  
POD1000000004_S0000232 AND THERE WERE MORE PROBLEMS   WITHIN A MONTH OF THE I P O   CO FOUNDER MATT WADIAK STEPPED DOWN AS C O O   MATT SALZBERG   THEN THE C E O   RESIGNED HIS POST SHORTLY THEREAFTER  
POD1000000004_S0000233 BLUE APRON'S EXPENSIVE BRAND SPANKING NEW FULFILLMENT CENTER IN NEW JERSEY HAD A BUNCH OF TECH BUGS THAT NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT   AND WORKERS FROM ITS CALIFORNIA OPERATION FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OVER A ALLEGED MISSING WAGES  
POD1000000004_S0000234 THINGS WERE LOOKING PRETTY GRIM FOR THE ONCE HYPED COMPANY  
POD1000000004_S0000235 WELCOME TO TRADING NATION   I'M ERIC CHEMI   LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF LAST YEAR'S HIGH PROFILE I P OS THAT'S GETTING ABSOLUTELY SMOKED   WE'RE TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT BLUE APRON   THE STOCK SINKING AS MUCH AS FOUR PERCENT ON FRIDAY  
POD1000000004_S0000236 BY THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN   BLUE APRON STOCK DIPPED BELOW A DOLLAR A SHARE AND THE SLIDE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE LETTING UP  
POD1000000004_S0000237 THE FOLLOWING SUMMER   THE COMPANY TRIED TO MOVE MEANT TO KEEP IT FROM BEING BOOTED FROM THE STOCK EXCHANGE   IT'S CALLED A REVERSE STOCKS  
POD1000000004_S0000238 SPLIT AND BASICALLY IT MEANS THAT THE COMPANY BUNDLED IT SHARES   SO YOU GET A FEWER TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES   BUT EACH SHARE IS WORTH MORE   LIKE TRADING IN FOUR QUARTERS FOR A DOLLAR  
POD1000000004_S0000239 THE MOVE RAISED THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE   BUT CUSTOMERS STILL WEREN'T FLOCKING TO BLUE APRON'S BOXES   NOW AT THIS POINT   I WOULD HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWEL   BUT NOT C E O LINDA FINDLEY KOZLOWSKI  
POD1000000004_S0000240 THE COMPANY WOULDN'T MAKE KOZLOWSKI AVAILABLE FOR A CHAT   BUT HERE SHE IS LAST YEAR ON C N B C'S SQUAWK ON THE STREETTALKING ABOUT HOW JAZZED SHE IS ABOUT BLUE APRON'S PROSPECTS  
POD1000000004_S0000241 AND OUR RECIPES   OUR INGREDIENTS   OUR CULINARY AUTHORITY   OUR BRAND RECOGNITION IS BY FAR STILL NUMBER ONE   SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO INVESTORS   THEY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING HERE   IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT GETTING EXECUTION RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY  
POD1000000004_S0000242 COOL   COOL   COOL   BUT ALSO BLUE APRON WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING DOWN WITH SOME STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES   SAYS MARKETWATCH'S TONYA GARCIA  
POD1000000004_S0000243 STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES WHICH   YOU KNOW   DOESN'T MEANS A LOT AND AND NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME   RIGHT  
POD1000000004_S0000244 IT'S LIKE SAYING I'M TOTALLY HAPPY BEING SINGLE   BUT I'D BE INTO DATING IF THE RIGHT PERSON CAME ALONG  
POD1000000004_S0000245 IT'S KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT COMPANIES WILL SAY WHEN THEY'RE JUST LIKE   WELL   WE'D BE OPEN TO   YOU KNOW   GETTING BOUGHT OR A PARTNERSHIP IF YOU'RE INTERESTED   YOU KNOW   KIND OF A THING  
POD1000000004_S0000246 IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY   BLUE APRON PUT THE WORD OUT THAT IT WAS INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY GETTING SCOOPED UP   MAYBE BY A BIG GROCERY CHAIN   OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH DEEP POCKETS WHO WANTED TO OWN A MEAL KIT DELIVERY BUSINESS  
POD1000000004_S0000247 AT THE SAME TIME   GARCIA SAYS   THE COMPANY ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN TURNAROUND MODE   IT DECIDED TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS   INCLUDING SHUTTING DOWN ITS FULFILLMENT CENTER IN TEXAS  
POD1000000004_S0000248 IT ALSO DID AWAY WITH TRYING TO SHOVEL EVERYONE WHO HAD EVER EATEN FOOD INTO THE TOP OF ITS CUSTOMER FUNNEL  
POD1000000004_S0000249 THEY'VE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY CALL THEIR CORE CUSTOMERS   AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOING TO DO LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND USE A COUPON AND   YOU KNOW   GET BLUE APRON FOR A MONTH AND THEN CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTION  
POD1000000004_S0000250 SO AT THE SAME TIME   BLUE APRON WAS LOOKING TO SELL   IT WAS ALSO DOUBLING DOWN ON ITS MISSION   THESE WERE LAST GASP EFFORTS   IT WANTED TO SAVE ITSELF  
POD1000000004_S0000251 AND THEN CAME THE MOST UNLIKELY LIFELINE ANYONE COULD THINK OF   A GLOBAL PANDEMIC   A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT REQUIRED THOSE OF US WITHOUT ESSENTIAL JOBS TO PRACTICALLY NEVER LEAVE OUR HOUSES  
POD1000000004_S0000252 ONLINE GROCERY DELIVERY SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF   AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE REMEMBERED ABOUT THIS COMPANY THEY HEARD ABOUT ON A PODCAST AD THREE YEARS AGO  
POD1000000004_S0000253 THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ACTUALLY A BIT OF A GOOD THING FOR THEM BECAUSE IT HAS RAISED DEMAND  
POD1000000004_S0000254 BLUE APRON SEES A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN WHAT THE COMPANY IS OFFERING   ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MORE AMERICANS SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN COOKING AT HOME   THANKS   CORONA  
POD1000000004_S0000255 IF YOU'RE BLUE APRON   THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING   YOU KNOW   WELL   IF WE DO A GOOD JOB   SOME OF THIS WILL STICK  
POD1000000004_S0000256 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY   WHEN CORONAVIRUS BROUGHT AMERICA TO A STANDSTILL   BLUE APRON CUSTOMER ORDERS WERE UP A BIT   THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SPIKE LIKE THE MARKETS HOPED   THE COMPANY STILL LOST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS   BUT THAT WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER  
POD1000000004_S0000257 ON ITS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CALL OF TWENTY TWENTY   THE COMPANY'S C E O AND C F O SHOOK THEIR POM POMS LIKE THEY WERE ON AN EPISODE OF CHEERS BUT LIKE THE VERSION THAT FEATURES SLIGHTLY WOODEN CORPORATE EXECUTIVES  
POD1000000004_S0000258 SO NOW I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THING   UM YOU KNOW   PUTS US IN A GOOD POSITION GOING FORWARD   AND   AND AH   YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY UM GUIDE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES  
POD1000000004_S0000259 YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOME POSITIVE UM EFFECTS AS WE MOVE OUT OF Q TWO  
POD1000000004_S0000260 THE PANDEMIC SEEMS LIKE IT'S GIVEN BLUE APRON A DECENT LITTLE BOOST   IN THE SECOND QUARTER THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN TWENTY THOUSANDS MORE SUBSCRIBERS   BUT THAT'S STILL WAY BELOW WHERE THEY WERE IN TWENTY NINETEEN  
POD1000000004_S0000261 IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS WHETHER BLUE APRON SPECIFICALLY AND MEAL KIT DELIVERY MORE GENERALLY ARE HERE TO STAY   THE BUSINESS KICKI THEANDER FOUNDED IN SWEDEN THIRTEEN YEARS AGO IS STILL DELIVERING WEEKLY MEAL FIXINGS TO BUSY SWEDES  
POD1000000004_S0000262 AND DESPITE ITS OWN TURBULENCE   MARKET LEADER HELLOFRESH IS STILL CRANKING OUT BOXES   AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF SMALL MEAL KIT COMPANIES LOOKING TO FILL PALEO OR VEGAN OR REGIONAL CUISINE NICHES  
POD1000000004_S0000263 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WILL BE ON HOW WE EAT AND WHERE AND WHEN   NOT YET ANYWAY   GROCERY DELIVERY SEEMS LIKE IT'S HERE TO STAY  
POD1000000004_S0000264 MAYBE HIGH END RESTAURANT TAKEOUT WILL ALSO STICK AROUND IN SOME FORM   IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO TOOK UP HOME COOKING OUT OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BAKE CRUSTY SOURDOUGH AND WHIP UP ELABORATE CURRIES WHEN WE CAN ALL SAFELY FREQUENT OUR FAVORITE LOCAL SPOTS  
POD1000000004_S0000265 BLUE APRON IS BANKING ON A SEA CHANGE IN HOW AMERICANS EAT   THE COMPANY THAT WAS SHOPPING FOR A BUYER JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT IS NOW TRYING TO TURN A CATACLYSMIC GLOBAL EVENT INTO A BUSINESS SAVING OPPORTUNITY

POD1000000010_S0000003 THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD   GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE IN PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000004 HER NAME IS SCARLETT LEWIS   AND BEFORE WE MET HER   CORY   I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I WASN'T NECESSARILY ALL THAT IMPRESSED WITH KINDNESS   AS AN IDEA   I MEAN  
POD1000000010_S0000005 YOU'RE A KINDNESS SKEPTIC  
POD1000000010_S0000006 WELL   I DON'T WANNA SAY SKEPTIC   BUT JUST   LET'S SAY THAT KINDNESS IS LIKE A SLOGAN THAT'S ON A PILLOW THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE ON MY COUCH  
POD1000000010_S0000007 BUT THAT REALLY   REALLY CHANGED FOR ME WHEN WE TRAVELED TO RURAL CONNECTICUT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH SCARLETT  
POD1000000010_S0000009 I'VE LIVED ON THIS FARM FOR TWENTY YEARS AH BEFORE THE TWO BOYS   AND IT'S REALLY MY DREAM PLACE  
POD1000000010_S0000010 SCARLETT NAMED THIS PLACE WILD ROSE FARM   THERE A FEW CHICKENS CLUCKING IN A WIRE COOP BEHIND A MUDDY PASTURE   WHERE THERE'S ALSO A HORSE  
POD1000000010_S0000011 THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST FARMS IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY  
POD1000000010_S0000012 REALLY  
POD1000000010_S0000013 YEAH   THE HOUSE IS SEVENTEEN FORTY   SO OLDER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
POD1000000010_S0000014 WE GET THERE IN TIME TO WATCH HER FEED THE ANIMALS   INCLUDING HER CONSTANT COMPANIONS   THREE DOGS   REMINGTON   ROCKY AND OLIVE  
POD1000000010_S0000015 HE'S HUNGRY   TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000016 I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT THE MIKE WAS A DOG   WATCH OUT  
POD1000000010_S0000017 SO SCARLETT LEADS US INSIDE THE HOUSE   AND I REMEMBER WE TOOK OUR JACKETS OFF IN THE MUD ROOM   AND HANGING THERE WAS A FIRST GRADER'S BLACK AND BLUE SKI JACKET  
POD1000000010_S0000018 AND SCARLETT STOPPED   AND SHE PULLED OUT A PAIR OF THESE FUNNY LOOKING TEETH OUT OF THE POCKET   JOKE TEETH  
POD1000000010_S0000019 I ALWAYS SAY THAT HE WORE THESE LITTLE TEETH CAUSE HE WAS SUCH A GOOFBALL TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY  
POD1000000010_S0000020 LITTLE SILVER TEETH  
POD1000000010_S0000021 YEAH  
POD1000000010_S0000022 AH  
POD1000000010_S0000023 SCARLETT'S SON   JESSE   HAD THESE TEETH IN THIS COAT AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE DAY HE DIED  
POD1000000010_S0000024 MY NAME'S SCARLETT LEWIS   AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE MOVEMENT  
POD1000000010_S0000025 AND I FOUNDED THIS ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF MY SIX YEAR OLD SON   ALONGSIDE NINETEEN OF HIS CLASSMATES AND SIX EDUCATORS   IN ONE OF THE WORST MASS MURDERS IN U S HISTORY  
POD1000000010_S0000026 HERE IN SANDY HOOK   CONNECTICUT   IN TWENTY TWELVE   SCARLETT LIVED THROUGH EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE  
POD1000000010_S0000027 AND FOLLOWING THAT   I REALIZED THAT AH THERE ISN'T A THEY OUT THERE  
POD1000000010_S0000028 AND BY THEY SHE MEANS SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S GONNA COME INTO OUR SCHOOLS   AND OUR HOMES   AND HELP KIDS REPLACE THEIR ANGER AND VIOLENCE WITH WARMTH AND COMPASSION  
POD1000000010_S0000029 RIGHT THEN WE COME INTO THE SUNNY KITCHEN   WHICH IS PAINTED TURQUOISE AND BRIGHT YELLOW  
POD1000000010_S0000030 EVERY SURFACE IS COVERED WITH PAINTINGS SCARLETT'S DONE AND PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HIS BROTHER   J T  
POD1000000010_S0000031 AND ONE OF THE CABINETS HAS CHALKBOARD PAINT ON IT   AND ON IT IS A MESSAGE FROM JESSE  
POD1000000010_S0000032 WE   WE   HARDLY EVER USE THIS   THIS IS AH SPRAY PAINTED CHALKBOARD  
POD1000000010_S0000033 SCARLETT DIDN'T NOTICE THIS MESSAGE UNTIL SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING TO FIND CLOTHES FOR JESSE TO WEAR IN HIS CASKET  
POD1000000010_S0000034 SHE WALKED IN AND FROZE  
POD1000000010_S0000035 I SAW THAT NURTURING   HEALING   LOVE AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT  
POD1000000010_S0000036 NURTURING   HEALING   LOVE   YOU CAN SEE THOSE THREE WORDS   THEY'RE SPELLED PHONETICALLY IN A SIX YEAR OLD'S JAGGED SCRAWL  
POD1000000010_S0000037 I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COME BACK HERE   I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M CRYING CAUSE USUALLY I DON'T   SORRY  
POD1000000010_S0000038 I'M USUALLY REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING IT TOGETHER   AH   JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT   AH  
POD1000000010_S0000040 SCARLETT SAYS SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW OR WHERE HER LITTLE BOY CAME UP WITH THOSE THREE WORDS  
POD1000000010_S0000041 BUT THE MOMENT SHE SAW THEM   SHE REALIZED  
POD1000000010_S0000042 THIS IS MY LIFE NOW   I KNEW I WOULD BE SPENDING THE REST OF MY LIFE SPREADING THIS MESSAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000043 AND BY THE WAY   SIX YEARS LATER   YOU CAN TELL WHAT A MOMENT IT WAS BECAUSE IT'S ALL I TALK ABOUT   IT'S ALL I DO  
POD1000000010_S0000044 IT IS THE FOCUS OF MY LIFE EVERY WAKING MOMENT   EVERY BREATH   EVERY WORD THAT COMES OUT OF MY MOUTH IS ABOUT NURTURING   HEALING   LOVE   REALLY

POD1000000010_S0000059 SO   CORY   YES   KINDNESS IS IMPORTANT   BUT I GUESS I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED THAT MY KIDS WOULD LEARN IT NATURALLY   THROUGH OSMOSIS  
POD1000000010_S0000060 JUST IF YOU LOVE THEM   THEY'LL BECOME KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000061 WELL   YOU KNOW WHAT   ANYA   YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THAT ASSUMPTION  
POD1000000010_S0000062 WE OFTEN JUST EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE KIND WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT IT  
POD1000000010_S0000063 WE THINK   OH YOU'RE A GOOD KID   YOU'RE GONNA BE KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000064 THAT IS JENNIFER KOTLER   SHE'S ONE OF OUR EXPERT GUIDES TODAY THROUGH WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE A PRETTY COMPLICATED SUBJECT  
POD1000000010_S0000065 KINDNESS HAS BEEN A PART OF SESAME STREET FROM THE BEGINNING SO IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT   BUT  
POD1000000010_S0000066 BUT   SHE SAYS   THE FOLKS AT SESAME AND LOTS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS ARE STARTING TO NOTICE THINGS   WARNINGS  
POD1000000010_S0000067 NOT ONLY IN THE HEADLINES   BUT IN RESEARCH  
POD1000000010_S0000068 AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FIRST TAKEAWAY   THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SENDING KIDS REALLY MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000069 EXHIBIT A IS THIS STUDY JEN POINTS TO OUT OF HARVARD A FEW YEARS BACK  
POD1000000010_S0000070 MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN   FOR EXAMPLE   THOUGHT THAT THEIR PARENTS VALUED ACADEMIC SUCCESS OVER KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000071 IN FACT   ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN BELIEVED THEIR PARENTS WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GOOD GRADES AND THEIR KIDS CAREERS THAN WHETHER THEY WERE CARING TOWARDS OTHERS  
POD1000000010_S0000072 EIGHTY PERCENT   AND THE PARENTS   ON THE OTHER HAND   THEY GOT SURVEYED   TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000073 AND THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THIS   THEY THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR KIDS WERE GETTING  
POD1000000010_S0000074 YEAH   AND THIS KIND OF   LIKE   SELF DELUSION   THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS SCARLETT WORRIES THAT THIS CULTURE IS CREATING HUGE PROBLEMS  
POD1000000010_S0000075 NOW AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS  
POD1000000010_S0000076 AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND BULLYING AND LONELINESS   BUT ALSO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL ILLNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000077 AND OF COURSE   HER LIFE IS A REALLY STARK REMINDER   CORY   OF JUST HOW HIGH THE STAKES CAN BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND KIDS WHO ARE TROUBLED  
POD1000000010_S0000078 SOMETIMES IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE WE ACT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO  
POD1000000010_S0000079 AND WE DO KNOW WHAT TO DO  
POD1000000010_S0000080 AFTER SHE READ THAT MESSAGE FROM JESSE   SCARLETT LEWIS REACHED OUT TO A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS   AND SHE CREATED A PLAN TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CHILDREN KINDNESS   STEP BY STEP   VALUE BY VALUE  
POD1000000010_S0000081 YEAH   THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM   THEY ESTIMATE IT'S NOW REACHED OVER A MILLION STUDENTS  
POD1000000010_S0000082 IN FACT   IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO TREAT EACH OTHER  
POD1000000010_S0000083 YEAH   AND NOT JUST TO PREVENT THE NEXT TRAGEDY   BUT ALSO BECAUSE RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THESE NON ACADEMIC SKILLS   OFTEN CALLED SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS  
POD1000000010_S0000084 THEY MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE EQUATION THAT DETERMINES WHETHER KIDS ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LIVES  
POD1000000010_S0000085 SO LET'S FOLLOW SCARLETT'S LEAD AND SESAME STREET'S   AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE OF KINDNESS CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION  
POD1000000010_S0000087 TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO  
POD1000000010_S0000088 KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000089 BUT ALSO UNKIND  
POD1000000010_S0000090 HERE'S WHAT WE MEAN  
POD1000000010_S0000091 SO ON THE ONE HAND   PEOPLE HAVE NEURONS IN OUR BRAINS CALLED MIRROR NEURONS   AND THEY RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PAIN LIKE   WE'RE PICKED BY A NEEDLE AS WE DO WHEN WE WATCH SOMEONE ELSE EXPERIENCE PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000092 IT'S A MIRROR  
POD1000000010_S0000093 IT LIGHTS UP THE SAME RECEPTORS IN OUR BRAIN AS PHYSICAL PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000094 SOON AFTER BIRTH   CHILDREN   FOR EXAMPLE   WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO CRY AS A RESULT OF HEARING ANOTHER CHILD CRY THAN THEY ARE IN RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER SORT OF NOISE  
POD1000000010_S0000095 THOMAS LICKONA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS EVEN IN TINY BABIES  
POD1000000010_S0000096 HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WROTE THE BOOK ON HOW TO RAISE KIND KIDS   LITERALLY  
POD1000000010_S0000097 THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED   HE'S ALSO BEEN A FAMILY COUNSELOR   HAS TWO KIDS AND FIFTEEN GRANDKIDS  
POD1000000010_S0000098 AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABIES MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER  
POD1000000010_S0000099 STUDIES GOING BACK TO THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES HAVE FOUND INFANTS AS YOUNG AS THREE MONTHS OLD PREFER A KIND OR HELPER PUPPET OVER A MEAN   AGGRESSIVE CHARACTER  
POD1000000010_S0000100 SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING   CORY   I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000101 YEAH   BUT THE PROBLEM FOR KIDS IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF BARRIERS TO KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000102 FOR EXAMPLE   THERE'S A SMALL STUDY OF TWO YEAR OLDS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER CHILD'S DISTRESS   SAY   A FRIEND FELL DOWN ON THE PLAYGROUND  
POD1000000010_S0000103 ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM   WITH KINDNESS BY   SAY   GOING OVER TO THE CHILD   OFFERING A HUG   CALLING FOR AN ADULT  
POD1000000010_S0000104 ZACHARY  
POD1000000010_S0000106 LET'S CHECK ON HIM   BELLA   HE'S TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000107 HE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU UP  
POD1000000010_S0000108 YEAH   AND WE ACTUALLY SAW THIS KIND OF SCENE IN PERSON ON A RECENT TRIP THAT WE TOOK TO A PRESCHOOL ON THE CAMPUS OF EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY  
POD1000000010_S0000109 I'M GONNA HELP BELLA  
POD1000000010_S0000110 OH   GREAT   LET'S SEE  
POD1000000010_S0000111 WHAT A KIND FRIEND  
POD1000000010_S0000112 LET ME HELP YOU   BELLA  
POD1000000010_S0000114 AND IT REALLY GOT ME WONDERING   WOULD MY KIDS BE THAT ONE IN THREE   WOULD YOURS  
POD1000000010_S0000115 YEAH   I DON'T KNOW   I MEAN   I REALLY HOPE SO  
POD1000000010_S0000116 BUT WHAT IS IT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THAT KINDNESS   THAT ACT OF KINDNESS IN THE MOMENT  
POD1000000010_S0000117 A BUNCH OF THINGS  
POD1000000010_S0000118 AH YOUNG KIDS ARE NATURALLY SELF CENTERED  
POD1000000010_S0000119 SURE  
POD1000000010_S0000120 EVERY PARENT KNOWS THAT  
POD1000000010_S0000121 AH SO THEY MIGHT JUST BE OBLIVIOUS TO ANOTHER CHILD'S PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000122 YOU KNOW   AND THERE'S ALSO INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT   RIGHT  
POD1000000010_S0000123 SO SOME KIDS  
POD1000000010_S0000124 THEY REALLY CAN'T HANDLE OTHER KIDS PAIN   THEY THEY SHUT DOWN  
POD1000000010_S0000125 OR MAYBE THEY'RE REALLY SHY   THEY'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO STEP UP  
POD1000000010_S0000126 YOU KNOW   DECADES OF PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH TELLS US THIS IS A GROWN UP PROBLEM   TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000127 SOMETIMES THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY SERVES AS AN INHIBITION  
POD1000000010_S0000128 BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER   MORE DISTURBING   BARRIER TO KINDNESS THAT ADULTS REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HERE   AND IT'S PREJUDICE  
POD1000000010_S0000129 SO THERE'S ANOTHER YALE STUDY OF SIX TO EIGHT MONTH OLD BABIES  
POD1000000010_S0000130 AH UM  
POD1000000010_S0000131 THEY WANTED A PUPPET THAT DID NOT SHARE THEIR SNACK PREFERENCE PUNISHED  
POD1000000010_S0000132 PUNISHED  
POD1000000010_S0000133 YEAH   SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT THESE BABIES SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK   OR BEHAVE OR THINK LIKE THEY DO   BUT ALSO A KIND OF HOSTILITY TO THOSE THAT DON'T  
POD1000000010_S0000134 WOW  
POD1000000010_S0000135 YEAH   SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS   CHILDREN AND GROWN UPS ALIKE DON'T ALWAYS REACH OUT TO HELP  
POD1000000010_S0000136 INSTEAD   WE OFTEN DO THE OPPOSITE  
POD1000000010_S0000137 IT'S TRUE   WE HIDE FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN   WE RUN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY  
POD1000000010_S0000138 AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS  
POD1000000010_S0000139 YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THE SKILLS AND TOOLS  
POD1000000010_S0000140 WHAT YOU NEED IS THE COURAGE TO BE WITH SOMEBODY IN PAIN AND JUST BE PRESENT  
POD1000000010_S0000142 AND THAT'S OUR THIRD TAKEAWAY  
POD1000000010_S0000143 KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000144 THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000145 AND I WANNA MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000146 WHEN THE SHOOTER STOPPED TO RELOAD   HE YELLED RUN   AND THE INVESTIGATORS SAID THAT HE SAVED MANY OF HIS CLASSMATES LIVES IN THAT MOMENT  
POD1000000010_S0000147 YEAH   AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF  
POD1000000010_S0000149 COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000151 HEROIC COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000152 UM FOR HER   IT INCLUDES THE COURAGE TO REACH OUT TO A HURTING FRIEND ON THE PLAYGROUND OR OR A CHILD YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW  
POD1000000010_S0000153 YEAH   ABSOLUTELY   I I MEAN   THE COURAGE TO OFFER COMFORT TO SOMEONE WHO'S LOST A LOVED ONE   EVEN IF THE IDEA OF DEATH IS REALLY SCARY TO YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000154 IT'S ALSO   SCARLETT SAYS   THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES  
POD1000000010_S0000155 GOSH   YOU KNOW   WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU ACT THAT WAY  
POD1000000010_S0000156 WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE  
POD1000000010_S0000157 I FEEL COMPASSION FOR YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000158 AH AH I SEE THE PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000159 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO HELP EASE THAT PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000160 YOU KNOW   HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME   CORY   BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS  
POD1000000010_S0000161 I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLETT  
POD1000000010_S0000162 I MEAN   SOMEONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT I   AS A PARENT   FEAR SO MUCH AND TO LOOK THAT PAIN IN THE FACE  
POD1000000010_S0000163 BUT THE WAY THAT SHE HAS TRANSFORMED THAT EXPERIENCE INTO A POSITIVE LEGACY IS IS SO INSPIRING  
POD1000000010_S0000165 ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM  
POD1000000010_S0000166 THEY PRACTICE BRAVE POSES AND BRAVE BREATHS   TO STAND UP TALL LIKE SUPERHEROES AND CALM DOWN THEIR BODIES AND THEIR MINDS  
POD1000000010_S0000167 YEAH   THERE ARE FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS   WHICH MAKE UP OUR FOURTH TAKEAWAY  
POD1000000010_S0000168 YEAH   TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR  
POD1000000010_S0000169 KINDNESS TAKES MINDFULNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000170 JEN KOTLER AT SESAME SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS   YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S  
POD1000000010_S0000171 AND YOU'LL BE LESS LIKELY TO LASH OUT VIOLENTLY IN FRUSTRATION OR ANGER  
POD1000000010_S0000172 SELF REGULATION IS SOMETHING WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH  
POD1000000010_S0000173 AND THAT'S WHY MINDFULNESS IS SO IMPORTANT AND REALLY LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE OUR OWN EMOTIONS  
POD1000000010_S0000174 AND I THINK THE EARLIER THAT WE CAN PRACTICE THOSE SKILLS   THE BETTER WE'LL BE IN ADULTHOOD  
POD1000000010_S0000175 IN FACT   THE FOLKS AT SESAME ARE SO CONVINCED OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND KINDNESS THAT THEY LIKE TO USE A SPECIAL WORD   KINDFULNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000176 YOU HEAR THAT   MERRIAM WEBSTER  
POD1000000010_S0000178 ANYWAY   LOTS OF THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS INTRODUCE TOOLS LIKE MEDITATION   RELAXATION   YOGA TO HELP KIDS WORK ON THIS BODY MIND CONNECTION  
POD1000000010_S0000179 SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE COURAGE THAT IT TAKES TO STEP IN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS HURTING   EVEN IF THAT PERSON IS BEING HURTFUL TOWARDS YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000180 AND HOW TO CULTIVATE THAT QUIET IN YOUR MIND THAT LETS YOU DO THAT  
POD1000000010_S0000181 OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY IS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR CHILD HURTS SOMEONE ELSE   ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENTIONALLY  
POD1000000010_S0000182 OR   ON THE OTHER HAND   WHEN SOMEONE ELSE HURTS YOUR CHILD  
POD1000000010_S0000183 TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE  
POD1000000010_S0000184 APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL  
POD1000000010_S0000185 AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF  
POD1000000010_S0000186 YEAH   BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP   SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM  
POD1000000010_S0000187 I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER BRIEFLY THAT WE WERE TOLD WE DON'T FORCE CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER  
POD1000000010_S0000188 AND I REMEMBER IN MY EARLY TWENTIES THINKING   THAT'S ABSURD  
POD1000000010_S0000189 YOU SHOULD TOTALLY TELL CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER  
POD1000000010_S0000190 THE PROBLEM   JEN FOUND OUT   WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS  
POD1000000010_S0000191 SORRY  
POD1000000010_S0000192 THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MEAN IT   YOU KNOW   OR FEEL IT  
POD1000000010_S0000193 YEAH   SO TOM LICKONA AND JEN KOTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARROTING THE WORDS   SORRY  
POD1000000010_S0000194 WE SHOULD HELP THEM REALLY TAKE THE OTHER PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT REPAIR THE HARM DONE  
POD1000000010_S0000195 YEAH   AND THIS IS A GREAT TIP  
POD1000000010_S0000196 JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS  
POD1000000010_S0000197 AND DIRECT ONE CHILD TO LOOK AT THE OTHER CHILD'S FACE AND POSTURE  
POD1000000010_S0000198 AND THIS HELPS THEM LEARN HOW TO READ FEELINGS  
POD1000000010_S0000199 SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT MORE CONVERSATIONS AND ABOUT LOOKING AT EMOTIONS AND EMOTION KNOWLEDGE AND LOOKING AT FACES TO SEE HOW YOUR ACTIONS AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE  
POD1000000010_S0000200 JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW  
POD1000000010_S0000201 IT NOW HAS CHARACTERS DISCUSS WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY AND HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER  
POD1000000010_S0000202 SO ELMO MIGHT SAY   I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER   AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT  
POD1000000010_S0000203 AND I REALIZED THAT YOU PROBABLY WANTED A TURN   TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000204 AND I SHOULD LET YOU HAVE THE TIME WITH IT  
POD1000000010_S0000206 YOU'LL GET IT   ZOE  
POD1000000010_S0000207 BUT BUT BUT WAIT   WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN   ELMO  
POD1000000010_S0000208 ELMO ELMO CAN BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR HIS TURN  
POD1000000010_S0000209 SO WHAT DO YOU SAY   ZOE  
POD1000000010_S0000210 AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTER WOULD SAY   YES   THAT'S HOW I WAS FEELING THAT YOU WEREN'T SHARING  
POD1000000010_S0000211 AND IT WAS HURTING MY FEELINGS   AND THEN WHEN YOU SHARED   IT MADE ME FEEL BETTER  
POD1000000010_S0000212 YEAH  
POD1000000010_S0000214 ALL RIGHT   NICE JOB SHARING   ELMO  
POD1000000010_S0000215 ALL RIGHT   THANKS  
POD1000000010_S0000216 SO IN THAT INTERACTION   YOU'RE GIVING CHILDREN A LOT OF LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY'RE FEELING  
POD1000000010_S0000217 THAT MAY BE A LOT TO EXPECT FROM A TWO YEAR OLD  
POD1000000010_S0000218 BUT   YOU KNOW   APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL   KIND OF LIKE LEARNING TO SCOOTER  
POD1000000010_S0000219 AND THEY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE  
POD1000000010_S0000220 YEAH   AND STARTING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS EARLY IS CRUCIAL TO RAISING A CHILD WHO RUNS TO HELP WHEN SOMEBODY'S HURT  
POD1000000010_S0000221 SO REMEMBER THAT SMALL STUDY WE MENTIONED OF KIDS ON THE PLAYGROUND  
POD1000000010_S0000222 WELL   IT ALSO LOOKED IN DEPTH AT THE PARENTING STYLES OF THEIR MOTHERS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS  
POD1000000010_S0000223 WHEN ONE CHILD HURT ANOTHER   MANY OF THE MOTHERS RESPONDED WITH SOMETHING CASUAL AND BLAND  
POD1000000010_S0000224 YEAH   LIKE OH DON'T DO THAT  
POD1000000010_S0000225 BUT THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE MOMS OF THE HELPER KIDS   THOSE ONE IN THREE WHO RAN TO HELP   THEY WERE DIFFERENT  
POD1000000010_S0000226 YEAH   THEY WERE WARM AND NURTURING   BUT THEY ALSO TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEIR CHILD HURT ANOTHER CHILD  
POD1000000010_S0000227 SO THEY'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE  
POD1000000010_S0000228 YOU HURT AMY  
POD1000000010_S0000229 PULLING HAIR HURTS   NEVER PULL HAIR  
POD1000000010_S0000230 AND AS A RESULT   THE CHILD WAS MORE LIKELY TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY LATER ON AND RESPOND COMPASSIONATELY WHEN SHE SAW ANOTHER CHILD CRYING ON THE PLAYGROUND  
POD1000000010_S0000231 TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION  
POD1000000010_S0000232 WHAT WE GROWN UPS MIGHT CALL RESTITUTION   IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING   YOU FIX IT   WHETHER IT'S A BROKEN TOY OR A HURT FEELING  
POD1000000010_S0000233 THIS IS ALSO WHERE THINGS GET HARD FOR US GROWN UPS   TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000234 YEAH  
POD1000000010_S0000235 BECAUSE ALL THE EXPERTS WE SPOKE WITH WERE REALLY CLEAR   KIDS DO WHAT THEY SEE  
POD1000000010_S0000236 AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS SCREW UP   WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO  
POD1000000010_S0000237 WOW   MOM MADE A MISTAKE   YOU KNOW  
POD1000000010_S0000238 AH AND I MISINTERPRETED WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE  
POD1000000010_S0000239 AND I GOT ANGRY   I'M SORRY   YOU KNOW   CAN YOU GUYS FORGIVE ME  
POD1000000010_S0000240 IF ANYTHING   SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY   FORGIVENESS  
POD1000000010_S0000241 THAT'S ONE OF THE FOUR CORE VALUES OF HER CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM   ALONG WITH COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000242 AND SHE SAYS WHEN SHE FIRST PITCHED THE PROGRAM   PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT FORGIVENESS  
POD1000000010_S0000243 THAT'S A VERY LOFTY TOPIC FOR KIDS  
POD1000000010_S0000244 DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED  
POD1000000010_S0000245 NOT AT ALL   SHE SAYS  
POD1000000010_S0000246 THE CHOOSE LOVE CLASSROOMS HAVE TURNED FORGIVENESS INTO A HANDS ON EXERCISE  
POD1000000010_S0000247 WE LITERALLY TAKE STRING AND SCISSORS   AND WE CUT THE CORD   UM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I TALK ABOUT IT  
POD1000000010_S0000248 LIKE   IF YOU'RE ANGRY AT SOMEBODY   YOU'RE ATTACHED TO THEM WITH AN UMBILICAL CORD  
POD1000000010_S0000249 AND IT RUNS OUT OF YOUR SIDE INTO THE SIDE OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT  
POD1000000010_S0000250 I LOVE THIS   TOO   BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER  
POD1000000010_S0000251 AND SHE SAYS   YOU KNOW   HOLDING ONTO ANGER   IT CAN BE AS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AS SMOKING CIGARETTES  
POD1000000010_S0000252 AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WHERE   SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN   HER BACK IS TO HER REFRIGERATOR   WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HER OTHER SON   J T   AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK  
POD1000000010_S0000253 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS  
POD1000000010_S0000254 DID SHE FORGIVE THE PERSON WHO MURDERED HER SON  
POD1000000010_S0000255 ABSOLUTELY  
POD1000000010_S0000257 WITHOUT HESITATION   YEAH   I I WITHOUT HESITATION   I ABSOLUTELY FORGIVE HIM  
POD1000000010_S0000259 SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KINDNESS IN THE DARKEST HOURS   THOSE MOMENTS OF CONFLICT  
POD1000000010_S0000260 LOSS AND PAIN   HURT AND ANGER  
POD1000000010_S0000261 AND THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT  
POD1000000010_S0000262 I MEAN   THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY NEED KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000263 YEAH   BUT HOW DO YOU BUILD KINDNESS UP  
POD1000000010_S0000264 WELL   IF YOU WANT TO REALLY GROW KIND PEOPLE   THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD   WHEN YOU ARE FULL OF JOY  
POD1000000010_S0000265 THAT'S OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX   KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT  
POD1000000010_S0000266 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT  
POD1000000010_S0000267 YOU HAVE THE RAISE THE CAPITAL OF KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000268 AIJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND   CALIFORNIA  
POD1000000010_S0000269 AND SHE FOCUSED A LOT ON KINDNESS WHEN SHE TAUGHT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  
POD1000000010_S0000270 YOU HAVE TO POINT IT OUT  
POD1000000010_S0000271 YOU HAVE TO NAME IT  
POD1000000010_S0000272 YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT  
POD1000000010_S0000273 FOR EXAMPLE   EVERY DAY   SHE'D HOLD CIRCLE TIME  
POD1000000010_S0000274 AND A LOT OF TIMES   SHE'D ASK THIS  
POD1000000010_S0000275 YOU KNOW   WHAT WERE SOME WAYS THIS WEEK WHERE YOUR CLASSMATES WERE KIND TO YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000276 TURN AND SHARE A MOMENT WHERE YOU FELT SOMEONE WAS BEING REALLY KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000277 TOM LICKONA SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS  
POD1000000010_S0000278 IT'S ENCOURAGING KIDS TO IDENTIFY AS KIND PEOPLE  
POD1000000010_S0000279 YEAH   BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE KIND IF THEY SEE IT AS PART OF WHO THEY ARE  
POD1000000010_S0000280 YEAH   THIS IDEA OF TAKING SPECIAL NOTICE WHEN PEOPLE ARE KIND TO YOU   WELL   ANOTHER WORD FOR THAT COULD BE GRATITUDE  
POD1000000010_S0000281 YEAH   PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING   SHE TOLD US   IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF   EVEN OUT LOUD   WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR  
POD1000000010_S0000282 MY GRATITUDE LISTS ARE ALL DAY LONG  
POD1000000010_S0000283 AND I START IN THE MORNING BY TICKING OFF   AH THE SUN'S OUT   AND AH I CAN GET UP OUT OF BED   AND LITERALLY   LIKE   I'M TICKING THEM OFF ALL DAY  
POD1000000010_S0000284 UM AND WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON GRATITUDE   YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE LESSER ENERGY THOUGHTS  
POD1000000010_S0000285 AND TOM AGREES  
POD1000000010_S0000286 THERE'S A PAYOFF TO PRACTICING GRATITUDE IN THIS WAY  
POD1000000010_S0000287 NOT ONLY CAN RAISE THE STOCK OF KINDNESS IN YOUR FAMILY   IN YOUR CLASSROOM   BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE THANKFUL ARE ALSO HAPPIER  
POD1000000010_S0000288 YEAH   HE SUGGESTS THAT AT MEALTIMES   FOR EXAMPLE   FAMILIES GO AROUND AND MENTION THEIR GRATEFULS THINGS THAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR THAT DAY  
POD1000000010_S0000289 YEAH   WE DO THIS IN MY HOUSE  
POD1000000010_S0000291 ALL RIGHT   WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST  
POD1000000010_S0000292 ME   UM I'M THANKFUL FOR ANIMALS AND PANDAS

POD1000000010_S0000296 THANK YOU FOR UM THIS BREAKFAST UM  
POD1000000010_S0000297 AND  
POD1000000010_S0000298 BUT WE DO IT  
POD1000000010_S0000299 THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS TO REALLY CARVE OUT A TIME IN EACH DAY FOR YOUR KIDS AND YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE   YOU KNOW   WE'RE NOT SELF SUFFICIENT  
POD1000000010_S0000300 AH WE'RE NOT ISLANDS  
POD1000000010_S0000301 WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE   AND OTHER PEOPLE NEED US  
POD1000000010_S0000302 THAT'S A GREAT POINT   CORY   I'VE GOT TO TRY THAT  
POD1000000010_S0000304 WE'VE COME TO OUR FINAL TAKEAWAY   TAKEAWAY NUMBER SEVEN   KINDNESS REQUIRES  
POD1000000010_S0000305 PRACTICE   PRACTICE   PRACTICE  
POD1000000010_S0000306 YEAH   IN FACT   SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS  
POD1000000010_S0000307 WE WERE GONNA CHANGE THE NAME OF OUR PROGRAM FROM CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM TO CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PRACTICE  
POD1000000010_S0000308 AND SIMILARLY   TOM SAYS   KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM   IT'S A HABIT  
POD1000000010_S0000309 AND THAT'S NOT JUST CALLING OUT KINDNESS WHEN YOU SEE IT IN YOUR KIDS  
POD1000000010_S0000310 IT'S GIVING THEM LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE KIND   YOU KNOW  
POD1000000010_S0000311 AND YOU CAN START WITH CHORES AT HOME  
POD1000000010_S0000312 CHORES   YEAH   THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA  
POD1000000010_S0000313 SO TOM SAYS   YOU KNOW   NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER  
POD1000000010_S0000314 AND FOR MY DAUGHTER   LULU   WHO'S SEVEN   THAT CHORE AH REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT  
POD1000000010_S0000315 YOU KNOW   WHEN WE GOT THE CAT   SHE PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD HELP OUT NOT ONLY WITH THE FEEDING BUT ALSO THE LITTER BOX  
POD1000000010_S0000316 THIS IS REALLY GIVING HER THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER CREATURE DEPENDING ON HER  
POD1000000010_S0000317 YEAH   TOTALLY  
POD1000000010_S0000318 AND YOU CAN ALSO AND SHOULD   YOU KNOW   TAKE THIS MODEL   THIS IDEA AND TAKE IT OUT INTO YOUR COMMUNITY  
POD1000000010_S0000319 YOU KNOW   HAVE YOUR KIDS HELP PICK UP TRASH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR HELP FOLKS AT A SHELTER  
POD1000000010_S0000320 RAISE MONEY FOR A GOOD CAUSE   WHATEVER IT IS  
POD1000000010_S0000322 AND HERE'S THE REALLY GOOD NEWS   TOM TOLD US  
POD1000000010_S0000323 GETTING OUR KIDS TO BE HELPERS   TO BE IN SERVICE   IT DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT THE GROWN UPS THAT THEY BECOME  
POD1000000010_S0000324 DOING THIS REGULARLY ACTUALLY FEELS GOOD CHEMICALLY  
POD1000000010_S0000325 IT'S WHAT BRAIN RESEARCHERS CALL HELPER'S HIGH  
POD1000000010_S0000326 DOING A KIND ACT LIGHTS UP A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT LET'S US EXPERIENCE JOY  
POD1000000010_S0000327 AND THAT'S WHY   HE SAYS   WE'RE HAPPIER WHEN WE'RE HELPING   AND JEN AT SESAME AGREES  
POD1000000010_S0000328 KINDNESS REALLY DOES MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD  
POD1000000010_S0000329 AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS WE SHOULD TALK TO KIDS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS HELPER'S HIGH  
POD1000000010_S0000330 THERE'S SO MUCH SCIENCE THAT SHOWS   AND I SAY ALL THE NURTURING   HEALING LOVE THAT YOU GIVE OUT   YOU GET BACK  
POD1000000010_S0000331 SO THIS IS GETTING ME THINKING MORE ABOUT THAT STUDY OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WE OPENED THE EPISODE WITH  
POD1000000010_S0000332 UM AH  
POD1000000010_S0000333 YOU KNOW   OUR KIDS   THEY HEAR FROM US EVERY DAY   DO YOUR HOMEWORK  
POD1000000010_S0000334 STUDY FOR THE TEST  
POD1000000010_S0000335 HOW WELL DID YOU DO  
POD1000000010_S0000336 AND THEY HEAR US TALK ABOUT SWEATING SOME PROMOTION OR WORKING HARD ON A PROJECT  
POD1000000010_S0000337 BUT   YOU KNOW   DO WE EVER STOP AND ASK THEM   WERE YOU KIND IN CLASS TODAY  
POD1000000010_S0000338 YEAH   DID YOU HELP SOMEBODY WHO WAS HURTING OR SIT BY THAT KID WHO ALWAYS EATS ALONE  
POD1000000010_S0000339 IT'S NO WONDER OUR KIDS SO OFTEN THINK THAT WE VALUE GRADES MORE THAN KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000340 SO I'M THINKING MORE ABOUT HOW TO RAISE THE CAPITAL OF KINDNESS AT HOME  
POD1000000010_S0000341 AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE GREAT STRATEGIES   RIGHT  
POD1000000010_S0000342 YEAH   YEAH   I MEAN   THE THE GOAL HERE   EVERYONE WE TALKED TO SAID THIS SAID THIS WORD  
POD1000000010_S0000343 THEY USED THE WORD CULTURE  
POD1000000010_S0000344 YOU HAVE TO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOME OR THE CLASSROOM OR ANYWHERE  
POD1000000010_S0000346 TIME FOR A RECAP   ANYA  
POD1000000010_S0000347 ALL RIGHT   I'M FEELING LOVE   LET'S DO IT  
POD1000000010_S0000348 ALRIGHT  
POD1000000010_S0000349 HERE WE GO   TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE  
POD1000000010_S0000350 WE GROWN UPS SEEM TO STOP SENDING OUR KIDS MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000351 YEAH   WE SAY WE WANT OUR KIDS TO BE KIND   BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WALK THE WALK  
POD1000000010_S0000352 TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO   KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND BUT ALSO UNKIND  
POD1000000010_S0000353 YEAH   SO EMPATHY IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US HUMAN   BUT   AND THIS IS A BIG BUT  
POD1000000010_S0000354 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEELING SOMEONE ELSE'S PAIN AND ACTUALLY ACTING TO HELP  
POD1000000010_S0000355 YEAH   KINDNESS IS NOT JUST A FEELING   IT'S AN ACTION  
POD1000000010_S0000356 AND THAT'S WHY OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE IS KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE  
POD1000000010_S0000357 THE COURAGE TO EMBRACE OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN   THE COURAGE TO PUT OTHER PEOPLE'S NEEDS BEFORE YOUR OWN  
POD1000000010_S0000358 BUT ALSO COURAGE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S HURT YOU OR A FRIEND OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY NOT AS A BULLY  
POD1000000010_S0000359 BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S STRUGGLING  
POD1000000010_S0000360 THE KIND OF COURAGE TO SEE THE WORLD THE WAY SCARLETT LEWIS DOES  
POD1000000010_S0000361 THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD   GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE IN PAIN  
POD1000000010_S0000362 TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR   TO BUILD KINDNESS   PRACTICE MINDFULNESS  
POD1000000010_S0000363 BEING ABLE TO STAY CALM AND PATIENT WILL HELP YOU EVERY TIME  
POD1000000010_S0000364 ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOU  
POD1000000010_S0000365 SO TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE IS APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL   AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF  
POD1000000010_S0000366 REMEMBER   PARENTS AND TEACHERS ALIKE   THE OLD SINGSONGY SORRY   IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH  
POD1000000010_S0000367 AND WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HARM   FORGIVENESS MAY FEEL HARD   BUT IT WILL ALSO FEEL GOOD IN THE LONG RUN  
POD1000000010_S0000368 SPEAKING OF FEELING GOOD   OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX IS KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT  
POD1000000010_S0000369 OR   AS JEN AT SESAME SAYS  
POD1000000010_S0000370 WE OFTEN ARE QUICK TO TELL CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND TRYING TO CORRECT THEM FROM DOING SOMETHING WRONG  
POD1000000010_S0000371 INSTEAD   CAN WE SPEND MORE TIME CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING RIGHT   CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000372 SO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE RECOGNITION OF KINDNESS IN YOUR HOME AND IN YOUR CLASSROOM  
POD1000000010_S0000373 AND TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX   KINDNESS TAKES PRACTICE  
POD1000000010_S0000374 AND GROWN UPS CAN HELP WITH THAT BY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR KIDS TO BE KIND  
POD1000000010_S0000375 WHETHER THAT'S CHORES AT HOME OR FAMILY SERVICE PROJECTS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY  
POD1000000010_S0000377 AND THAT'S ALL FOR THIS EPISODE OF LIFE KIT FOR PARENTING WITH SESAME WORKSHOP  
POD1000000010_S0000378 AND ANYA   IT'S TIME FOR OUR GRATEFULS

POD1000000014_S0000008 HE HAS A LONG ASSOCIATION WITH WALES   WHERE HE OCCUPIED A VARIETY OF SENIOR POSITIONS IN HOUSING AND SOCIAL CARE  
POD1000000014_S0000009 HE THEN BECAME PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN FOR WALES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THIRTEEN

POD1000000014_S0000011 PETER   YOU'RE EXTREMELY WELCOME   THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US  
POD1000000014_S0000012 THANK YOU   ROB   VERY GLAD TO BE HERE  
POD1000000014_S0000013 PETER   UM I'M VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR A BIT ABOUT YOUR EARLY LIFE  
POD1000000014_S0000014 WHERE WERE YOU BORN   AND   TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WERE INSTILLED IN YOU WHEN YOU GREW UP  
POD1000000014_S0000015 UM THANK YOU   ROB   I WAS BORN IN DUBLIN   I WAS BORN INTO A FAIRLY ORDINARY WORKING CLASS HOME  
POD1000000014_S0000016 MY DAD WAS A UM MECHANIC WITH THE STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY   MY MOTHER WAS UM   AS WAS THE CASE WITH MANY IN THE DAY   A HOUSEWIFE  
POD1000000014_S0000017 WE LIVED A VERY ORDINARY FAMILY LIFE  
POD1000000014_S0000018 I DIDN'T ENJOY SCHOOL   AND I WAS TAUGHT BY THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS   SO I HAVE SOME OF MY LEARNING TO THANK THEM FOR  
POD1000000014_S0000019 WAS AH I WOULDN'T SAY THEY CONTRIBUTED TO A A VERY HAPPY SCHOOLDAYS   BUT THE REST OF MY CHILDHOOD WAS VERY ENJOYABLE   SO  
POD1000000014_S0000020 MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE RELIGIOUS   IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT IRELAND AT THE TIME  
POD1000000014_S0000021 OUR HOUSE WAS BUSY   THERE WERE OFTEN RELATIVES OR NEIGHBOURS POPPING IN FOR CUPS OF TEA  
POD1000000014_S0000022 AND SO WAS A A PLEASANT PLACE TO GROW UP  
POD1000000014_S0000023 SO YOU HAD A COMMUNITY SERVICE BACKGROUND BEFORE GOING TO WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT   IS THAT'S   THAT'S CORRECT   ISN'T IT  
POD1000000014_S0000024 YES   SO I I WORKED FOR THE WELSH HOUSING AGENCY WHEN IT WAS SET UP   THAT WAS FUNDING HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS ON SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING  
POD1000000014_S0000025 BUT THEN I WENT TO WORK FOR CARDIFF HOUSING DEPARTMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000026 I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES LIKE HOMELESSNESS   AND SHELTERED HOUSING FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND SO ON  
POD1000000014_S0000027 AND ALSO MANAGED THE GYPSY SITES IN CARDIFF   SO VERY INTERESTING JOB  
POD1000000014_S0000028 BUT I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE INVOLVED IN MAINSTREAM HOUSING THROUGH THAT  
POD1000000014_S0000029 AND THEN   BEFORE YOU BECAME WELSH OMBUDSMAN   YOU WERE   YOU WERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ARTS COUNCIL OF WALES   WAS   WAS THAT GOOD FUN  
POD1000000014_S0000030 IT WAS VERY GOOD FUN   IT WAS AT A TIME SHORTLY AFTER THE CREATION OF THE WELSH ASSEMBLY  
POD1000000014_S0000031 THE GOVERNMENT IN WALES WAS INTERESTED IN NATION BUILDING   IF YOU LIKE   DOING THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER   AND THEY SAW THE ARTS AS A VALUABLE WAY OF DOING THAT  
POD1000000014_S0000032 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE   OBVIOUSLY   I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN COMMUNITY ARTS AND ARTS OUTREACH TO PEOPLE WHO WERE OTHERWISE EXCLUDED  
POD1000000014_S0000033 SO IT FITTED VERY WELL FOR ME   I I NEVER HAD ANY EXPERTISE IN THE ARTS   BUT I GREATLY ENJOYED IT  
POD1000000014_S0000034 AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD TIME FOR THE ARTS IN WALES  
POD1000000014_S0000035 NOW I THINK YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE OCCUPIED NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN JOBS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY  
POD1000000014_S0000036 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANYONE ELSE LIKE YOU IN THAT REGARD   BUT WHAT WAS IT LIKE MOVING FROM BEING OMBUDSMAN IN WALES TO OMBUDSMAN IN IN IRELAND  
POD1000000014_S0000037 IT WAS INTERESTING  
POD1000000014_S0000038 I THINK THE OMBUDSMAN IN WALES WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATION IN WALES  
POD1000000014_S0000039 UM BUT PARTICULARLY THE WORK FOCUSED WITHIN THE HEALTH SPHERE  
POD1000000014_S0000040 AND AN AWFUL LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE DEALT WITH WERE TO DO WITH CLINICAL JUDGEMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000041 SO   MOVING TO IRELAND   AND FIRSTLY I FOUND THAT I DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER CLINICAL JUDGEMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000042 BUT ALSO I HAVE JURISDICTION OVER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000043 SO WAS SIMILAR IN SOME WAYS TO WALES   BUT IT WAS A A BIGGER JOB   IF YOU LIKE  
POD1000000014_S0000044 IN THE CONTEXT OF THE A UM WHOLE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES TO DEAL WITH  
POD1000000014_S0000045 IN IRELAND YOU'RE ALSO   YOU WEAR MANY HATS   YOU'RE ALSO THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER  
POD1000000014_S0000046 AND YOU DEAL WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AH STANDARDS AS WELL  
POD1000000014_S0000047 IS IS THAT DO YOU FIND THAT AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF BEING OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000048 IT'S VERY HELPFUL IF YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THE SAME KINDS OF PRINCIPLES   YOU'RE COMMITTED TO GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES   YOU'RE COMMITTED TO OPENNESS   YOU'RE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY  
POD1000000014_S0000049 THOSE VALUES WORK ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HATS I WEAR  
POD1000000014_S0000050 I SUPPOSE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS   AS OMBUDSMAN   YOU MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS   BUT IN IRELAND   IN THE HISTORY OF THE OFFICE   THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN IMPLEMENTED  
POD1000000014_S0000051 AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER   YOU MAKE BINDING DECISIONS   BUT THOSE GET CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS  
POD1000000014_S0000052 SO   DESPITE WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK TO BE THE CASE   BEING AN OMBUDSMAN   IN SOME WAYS   IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF HAVING OUTCOMES ACHIEVED THAN HAVING BINDING POWERS AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER  
POD1000000014_S0000053 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO YOU AS IRISH OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000054 YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH THEM   BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN REAPPOINTED FOR A SECOND TERM   BUT   LOOKING BACK ON THE SIX YEARS THAT YOU'VE HAD   WHAT WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES  
POD1000000014_S0000055 THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACED WAS WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAGDALENE LAUNDRIES  
POD1000000014_S0000056 AS WE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES THERE   THIS WAS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL  
POD1000000014_S0000057 OFTEN YOUNG WOMEN WHO'D HAD BABIES   SOMETIMES SCHOOLCHILDREN   WHO'D BEEN HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL AND FORCED TO WORK FOR MANY YEARS IN LAUNDRIES  
POD1000000014_S0000058 WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION SCHEME   AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD CHOSEN TO INTERPRET THAT SCHEME VERY NARROWLY  
POD1000000014_S0000059 SO   THEY WERE EXCLUDING YOUNG WOMEN   PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME WERE YOUNG WOMEN AND HAD WORKED IN THE LAUNDRIES BUT BEEN DETAINED IN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS  
POD1000000014_S0000060 WHICH SHARED THE SAME SITES AS THE LAUNDRIES   BUT NOT TECHNICALLY RESIDENT IN THE LAUNDRIES  
POD1000000014_S0000061 SO WE LOOKED AT THAT AND FELT THAT THERE WAS A HUGE INJUSTICE   BUT THE INITIAL RESPONSE OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS TO REJECT OUR FINDINGS  
POD1000000014_S0000062 SO THAT REQUIRED A HIGH PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN   WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GOVERNMENT CHANGING ITS MIND  
POD1000000014_S0000063 TO BE FAIR   I SUSPECT IF MINISTERS HAD BEEN INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET   I DON'T THINK THAT THE REJECTION WE INITIALLY SAW WOULD HAVE HAPPENED  
POD1000000014_S0000064 DID ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO UM EXPERIENCED THIS DETRIMENT GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU   OR WAS THIS THE NATURE OF YOU SEEING THE UNFAIRNESS AND ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF  
POD1000000014_S0000065 NO   WE HAD A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES   BUT WE INVESTIGATED THE WHOLE SCHEME   AND SO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE KNOWN OF MY OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000066 SO THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE TO AN OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000067 AH YES   IT IS   YOU CAN INVESTIGATE  
POD1000000014_S0000068 EVEN IF YOU GET COMPLAINTS   SOMETIMES YOU'RE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY INVESTIGATE ON THE FACTS IF YOU CAN'T UNDERTAKE OWN INITIATIVE INVESTIGATIONS  
POD1000000014_S0000069 IF SOMETHING COMES UP THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT   THERE'S NO CONSTRAINTS ON ME LOOKING AT THAT  
POD1000000014_S0000070 AND PARTICULARLY   I'VE FOUND THAT AH IN THE CONTEXT OF EXCLUDED GROUPS IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL TO USE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T COME TO YOU CAN   NONETHELESS   HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE  
POD1000000014_S0000071 YEAH   AND IS THAT REGARDED AS CONTROVERSIAL IN IRELAND   I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SO  
POD1000000014_S0000072 NO   NO   IT'S JUST PART OF THE AH TOOLKIT AVAILABLE TO THE OFFICE   I DON'T THINK ANYBODY GIVES IT ANY SECOND THOUGHT  
POD1000000014_S0000073 AND YOU YOU BEHAVED VERY BRAVELY IN IN THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE AT ONE POINT   WHEN YOU WERE BEING BLOCKED BY MINISTERS   YOU THREATENED TO GO TO THE  
POD1000000014_S0000075 IS THAT   IS THAT RIGHT  
POD1000000014_S0000076 WHEN I WAS BEING BLOCKED BY OFFICIALS   I WENT TO THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND THROUGH HIM TO THE  
POD1000000014_S0000078 THE PRIME MINISTER  
POD1000000014_S0000079 I ASKED THAT THEY PERSONALLY LOOK TO RESOLVE THE MATTER   BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A A STARK INJUSTICE   SOME REFLECTED VERY POORLY ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND  
POD1000000014_S0000081 GONE THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE BOTH ACTED WITH GREAT EXPEDIENCY   AND THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THEIR INTERVENTION  
POD1000000014_S0000082 I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT HAVING THE KIND OF GUTS THAT YOU'VE SHOWN THROUGHOUT THIS  
POD1000000014_S0000083 AND THE   I HOPE YOU WILL SYMPATHISE WITH THOSE OMBUDSMEN THAT DON'T HAVE OWN INITIATIVE POWERS   BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GREAT HAND  
POD1000000014_S0000084 I DON'T THINK IT IS   I MEAN EVEN IN A WELSH CONTEXT   WHERE I DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THE TIME  
POD1000000014_S0000085 YOU COULD BE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING IN ONE HEALTH BOARD AND SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE ARISING ELSEWHERE  
POD1000000014_S0000086 BUT TECHNICALLY YOU COULDN'T EXTEND YOUR INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE BODY YOU WERE INVESTIGATING  
POD1000000014_S0000087 THAT ABILITY TO EXTEND AN INVESTIGATION TO COVER WHICHEVER BODIES ARE INVOLVED IS VERY POWERFUL  
POD1000000014_S0000088 SO A LOT OF MY WORK   LET'S SAY   WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES IN ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000089 AND I WILL BE LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS THAT ARE TO DO WITH HEALTHCARE   THAT ARE TO DO WITH ACCESS TO BENEFITS   THAT ARE TO DO WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS   ACCESS TO HOUSING  
POD1000000014_S0000090 OTHER THAN THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN PROVIDING THE ACCOMMODATION  
POD1000000014_S0000091 SO   IT IS JUST THAT CAPACITY TO BROADEN OUT AN INVESTIGATION   AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY TO INSTIGATE AN INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE COMPLAINTS  
POD1000000014_S0000092 NOW MY CURRENT OWN INITIATIVE INVESTIGATION IS LOOKING AT THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE UNDER SIXTY FIVE LIVING IN NURSING HOMES  
POD1000000014_S0000093 THAT'S BECOME A MUCH MORE PRESSING ISSUE AND THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS   ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE INTERVIEWED HAS ALREADY DIED   ANOTHER HAS CONTRACTED THE VIRUS  
POD1000000014_S0000094 SO ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE   FOR OBVIOUS REASONS   TO CONCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION  
POD1000000014_S0000095 WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WRITTEN TO THE LEADERS OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED AND TALKS LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000096 TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE SO THAT AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE LEARNT TO DATE IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION CAN   HOPEFULLY   HELP TO SHAPE THE POLICIES OF THE INCOMING GOVERNMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000097 CAN WE JUST MOVE ON A LITTLE BIT  
POD1000000014_S0000098 YOU   YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTE   WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND PRESTIGIOUS JOB WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE TO OMBUDSMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD  
POD1000000014_S0000099 WHAT ADDED VALUE DO YOU THINK THE I O I BRINGS TO   TO OUR DISCUSSIONS  
POD1000000014_S0000100 WELL   I THINK ONE THE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS IS   STRAIGHTFORWARDLY   LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER  
POD1000000014_S0000101 BEING AN OMBUDSMAN IS NECESSARILY AN ISOLATED ROLE   WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IS BE TOO CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SERVICES WHICH ARE WITHIN YOUR JURISDICTION  
POD1000000014_S0000102 SO CONSEQUENTLY   WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER THAN WE DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHOSE SERVICES WE'RE LOOKING AT   AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER IS VERY IMPORTANT  
POD1000000014_S0000103 THE I O I PROVIDES STRUCTURED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES   THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THE VERY VALUABLE THINGS WE'VE DONE  
POD1000000014_S0000104 IT PROVIDES BEST PRACTICE PAPERS TO SHOW HOW THINGS CAN BEST BE DONE  
POD1000000014_S0000105 AND OF COURSE   ROB   YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEST PRACTICE PAPER ON ON PEER REVIEW AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THAT FIELD  
POD1000000014_S0000106 AND   BUT ALSO   I THINK THE I O I HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN SUPPORTING OMBUDSMAN ORGANISATIONS UNDER THREAT  
POD1000000014_S0000107 WE'VE SEEN   FOR INSTANCE   COLLEAGUES IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO   BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB   ARE BEING THREATENED OR IGNORED BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS  
POD1000000014_S0000108 AND WE'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE BUDGETS BEING CUT   AND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE BEING DENOUNCED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND SO ON  
POD1000000014_S0000109 SO   THE SOLIDARITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY IS VERY IMPORTANT   BUT WE ALSO INTERVENE QUITE DIRECTLY  
POD1000000014_S0000110 I GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF UM CYPRUS   WHERE THE AUDITOR GENERAL WAS LOOKING TO INTERFERE IN THE WORK OF THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000111 FOLLOWING INTERVENTION FROM THE I O I AND OTHERS   WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS AND THE PARLIAMENT IN PARTICULAR   THE THREATS WERE WITHDRAWN  
POD1000000014_S0000112 AND IN POLAND THE OMBUDSMAN WAS THREATENED WITH LARGE CUTS TO HIS BUDGET   WE SENT IN A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY  
POD1000000014_S0000113 WE INTERVIEWED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS   WE INTERVIEWED THE JUDICIARY  
POD1000000014_S0000114 AND WE CARRIED OUT PRESS CONFERENCES   WE TALKED TO N G OS   AND WE MANAGED TO GET A STAY OF EXECUTION  
POD1000000014_S0000115 AND   SO   WE SAW MAJOR THREATS TO DEMOCRACY THERE   BUT OUR INTERVENTION   ALONG WITH THOSE OF OTHERS   HAS HELPED TO ENSURE THAT THAT OFFICE IS STILL THERE AND IS CONTINUING TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY  
POD1000000014_S0000116 THAT POLISH INTERVENTION WAS CRUCIAL  
POD1000000014_S0000117 AND WHAT'S ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT IT WAS YOU ACTUALLY WENT THERE   DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT  
POD1000000014_S0000118 BUT YOU PUT THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PRESSURE BY ASKING THEM TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING  
POD1000000014_S0000119 ABSOLUTELY SO   WE DID THAT IN PERSON AND WE DID IT THROUGH THE MEDIA SO THAT IT HAD A VERY HIGH PROFILE WITHIN POLAND   I THINK IT'S   AH IT'S NO GOOD  
POD1000000014_S0000120 I DID THE SAME IN CYPRUS   MEDIA INTERVIEWS AND TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND  
POD1000000014_S0000121 I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT SOLIDARITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT COMES JUST IN THE FORM OF THE LETTER   THOUGH SOMETIMES A LETTER CAN BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IN ITSELF  
POD1000000014_S0000122 BUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY SCALE THE INTERVENTION TO THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE  
POD1000000014_S0000123 WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A LOT WHEN WE'VE NOT BEEN ON THE RADIO   BUT  
POD1000000014_S0000124 HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT WE   AS OMBUDS   DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICAL MATTERS  
POD1000000014_S0000125 OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS A CULTURAL RELIC OF BRITISH IMPERIALISM  
POD1000000014_S0000127 WHATEVER ABOUT BRITISH IMPERIALISM   NO   I THINK IT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION  
POD1000000014_S0000128 I THINK THAT FOR AN OMBUDSMAN NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS OVERSEEING THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE STATE  
POD1000000014_S0000129 AND SO   THEREFORE   ANY COMMENT WE MAKE ON THOSE SERVICES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE POLITICAL  
POD1000000014_S0000130 WHAT WE CAN'T BE IS PARTY POLITICAL   AND WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS SPEAK BEYOND THE EVIDENCE OF OUR CASEBOOK  
POD1000000014_S0000131 SO I TALKED EARLIER ON ABOUT SEEKING TO UM EFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND TO TO PROMOTE PARTICULAR POLICIES TO FAVOUR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF PEOPLE  
POD1000000014_S0000132 BUT I'M DOING THAT ON THE BASIS OF INVESTIGATIONS I'M CARRYING OUT  
POD1000000014_S0000133 I'M NOT DOING IT AS PETER TYNDALL   CITIZEN   I'M DOING IT AS OMBUDSMAN OF IRELAND   BASED ON THE EVIDENCE FROM MY CASEBOOK  
POD1000000014_S0000134 AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES   I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO INTERVENE  
POD1000000014_S0000135 I THINK IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IF PEOPLE ARE SEEN TO BE INTERVENING ON ISSUES WHICH GO BEYOND THEIR OWN WORK AS OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000136 I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC  
POD1000000014_S0000137 BUT I DO THINK THAT   IF YOU'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE THAT EVIDENCE WHERE IT CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO YOU  
POD1000000014_S0000138 SO WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS THE END   BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW YOU'RE COPING WITH THE CORONAVIRUS  
POD1000000014_S0000139 WHAT SORT OF IMPACT HAS IT HAD   SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM   ON ON THE WAY YOU OPERATE  
POD1000000014_S0000140 YES   IT'S AN INTERESTING ONE  
POD1000000014_S0000141 UM THE THE FIRST THING WAS THAT WE SURPRISED OURSELVES BY BEING ABLE TO GET OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO WORK REMOTELY   MUCH QUICKER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE OTHERWISE  
POD1000000014_S0000142 I SUPPOSE IF IT'S PROVED ANYTHING   IT'S THAT   WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS   IT'S SURPRISING HOW LONG TERM PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED IN A HURRY  
POD1000000014_S0000143 AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE ALL OF OUR SERVICES   MORE OR LESS WITHOUT CHANGE   THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS  
POD1000000014_S0000144 WE'VE HAD SOME CHANGES IN VOLUMES OF WORK COMING TO US  
POD1000000014_S0000145 WE'VE PUT A BIT MORE EMPHASIS ON PROJECT WORK   BUT   BY AND LARGE   PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR COMPLAINTS TO US  
POD1000000014_S0000146 THEY CAN RING US   THEY CAN EMAIL US  
POD1000000014_S0000147 THEY CAN AH CONTACT US ON THE WEB  
POD1000000014_S0000148 UM WE'RE EVEN ABLE TO COLLECT OUR POST   THOUGH WE'RE DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM USING THE POST AT THE MOMENT   BUT THE EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT WE CAN KEEP GOING  
POD1000000014_S0000149 THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE ARE PROBABLY MORE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTIES BEING FACED BY THE SERVICES WE'RE DEALING WITH  
POD1000000014_S0000150 SO WE'VE TOLD THE HEALTH SERVICE   WE'VE TOLD NURSING HOMES   AND WE'VE TOLD THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION   WHICH DEALS WITH BENEFITS AND PENSIONS  
POD1000000014_S0000151 THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL TAKE THEM LONGER TO RESPOND TO US AND THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO  
POD1000000014_S0000152 SO   SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT   AND   BUT IN GENERAL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP GOING  
POD1000000014_S0000153 JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH  
POD1000000014_S0000154 WE HAD ONE GENTLEMAN STUCK IN POLAND WHO COULDN'T GET BACK TO IRELAND   WHO'D BEEN DENIED BENEFIT IN IRELAND   EVEN THOUGH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE IN IRELAND AND HE NORMALLY LIVED AND WORKED  
POD1000000014_S0000155 AND WE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE SUCCESSFULLY SO THAT HE GOT HIS BENEFITS   SO WE'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AS THEY ARISE  
POD1000000014_S0000156 I THINK IN THE LONGER TERM THERE'LL BE TWO THINGS   REALLY   ONE OF THEM IS JUST PRACTICAL  
POD1000000014_S0000157 WE NOW KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR MORE OF OUR PEOPLE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY FROM HOME   AND I CAN'T SEE US GOING BACK TO THE SITUATION BEFORE   WHERE ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DID THAT  
POD1000000014_S0000158 I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL WORK FROM HOME AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNT DURING THE CRISIS  
POD1000000014_S0000159 BUT THE SECOND ISSUE FOR ME HAS BEEN THE APPALLING DEATH TOLL AMONG PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE   MANY OF WHOM SHOULDN'T BE THERE  
POD1000000014_S0000160 AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN WORKING ON THEIR BEHALF AFTER THE CRISIS   TO MAKE SURE THAT   SHOULD THERE BE A RESURGENCE OR SHOULD SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THIS COME ALONG  
POD1000000014_S0000161 THAT THEY'RE NOT AS EXPOSED AND AS VULNERABLE AS THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000162 IT IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE FOR THE OMBUDSMAN TO BE LOOKING AT BOTH HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE MATTERS  
POD1000000014_S0000163 AND NOT   AS IN THIS COUNTRY   TO HAVE A SEPARATION WHERE ONE OMBUDSMAN LOOKS AT SOCIAL CARE AND THE OTHER LOOKS AT HEALTH  
POD1000000014_S0000164 I   I'LL   JUST IF I MAY   ROB   JUST ADD SOMETHING  
POD1000000014_S0000165 ONE THE THINGS THAT'S NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE U K   AND ENGLAND IN PARTICULAR   IS THAT THERE IS A SINGLE NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN IN IRELAND  
POD1000000014_S0000166 SO THAT ISSUES OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE CAN BOTH COME INTO MY JURISDICTION  
POD1000000014_S0000167 THE REALITY IS THESE THESE ARE COMPLEX   INTERLINKED ISSUES  
POD1000000014_S0000168 I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEM WITH TWO SEPARATE OMBUDSMAN OFFICES   IT'S COMPLICATED ENOUGH AS IT IS  
POD1000000014_S0000169 TRYING TO DO SO IN THE CONTEXT WHERE YOU HAVE M P FILTERS  
POD1000000014_S0000170 WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS APPLYING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U K   IS IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELVES  
POD1000000014_S0000171 BUT YOU MANAGE IT VERY WELL   ALONG WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000172 AND I HAVE TO SAY   YOU'VE MANAGED IN PRACTICE TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES   BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPOSSIBLY COMPLEX SCENARIO FOR COMPLAINANTS  
POD1000000014_S0000173 IN IRELAND   SOMEBODY WANTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES   THEY COME TO MY OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000174 IN YOUR CASE IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED  
POD1000000014_S0000175 AND I DO HOPE THAT THE PROPOSALS FOR OMBUDSMAN REFORM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN THE U K OVER RECENT YEARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY LOST  
POD1000000014_S0000176 AND THAT WE DO COME TO A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A PROPER NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR COMPLAINTS   REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTICULAR PUBLIC SERVICE THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT  
POD1000000014_S0000177 AND I DO HOPE THAT HAPPENS BEFORE I DIE   WHICH I'M INCREASINGLY BECOMING DOUBTFUL ABOUT   BUT WE'LL   WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE  
POD1000000014_S0000178 PETER   YOU CONDUCTED THE PEER REVIEW OF MY ORGANISATION   AND THEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN PARLIAMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000179 SO THAT WAS NOT AN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000180 AH WHAT WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING BEING THE PEER REVIEWER WHO HAD TO GO BEFORE THE U K PARLIAMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000181 IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE   ROBERT  
POD1000000014_S0000182 I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE CHALLENGING IF I HADN'T BEEN UM QUITE SO IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE YOUR OFFICE PROVIDES  
POD1000000014_S0000183 IT WASN'T AS THOUGH   WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE SERVICE   WE USED A LOT OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA  
POD1000000014_S0000184 AND OBVIOUSLY   AH WITH ANY OFFICE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT   BUT IN GENERAL I WAS ABLE TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO THE COMMITTEE AS THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT COMPLAINANTS WERE RECEIVING  
POD1000000014_S0000185 BUT ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN POWERS AND IN JURISDICTION THAT ARE CAUSING YOU DIFFICULTIES IN PRACTICE  
POD1000000014_S0000186 BUT THEN I SUPPOSE WHAT I'D WANT TO SAY   I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000187 AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE   THEY WERE VERY OPEN WITH US  
POD1000000014_S0000188 WE TALKED TO YOUR STAFF WITHOUT TALKING TO YOURSELF TO THE MANAGERS   SO WE WERE ABLE FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS A VIEW AS THEY SO FIT   AND I THINK PEOPLE WERE VERY COMPLEMENTARY  
POD1000000014_S0000189 SO I THINK   AS I SAY   IT WAS AN AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE  
POD1000000014_S0000190 IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING TO GO BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES   AND THE SESSION WAS QUITE SEARCHING  
POD1000000014_S0000191 I THINK THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO REASSURE ITSELF THAT THIS WASN'T SOME KIND OF HAGIOGRAPHY  
POD1000000014_S0000192 BUT WE WERE SATISFIED IN THE END THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SAY   NO   WE'VE LOOKED IN DETAIL AT THIS OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000193 THERE ARE AREAS WHICH CAN IMPROVE   BUT   BY AND LARGE   THIS IS AN IMPROVING SERVICE THAT'S DELIVERING GOOD QUALITY OMBUDSMAN SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND AND TO THE U K  
POD1000000014_S0000194 WELL   I THINK THE STRUCTURAL POINT IS THAT   THANKS TO THE I O I   THIS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF PEER REVIEW LOOKS LIKE IT HAS LEGS FOR THE WIDER OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY  
POD1000000014_S0000195 AND IT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY OF ADDING TO SCRUTINY OF OMBUDSMAN SCHEMES   SO THANK YOU FOR THE ROLE THAT YOU PLAYED IN PIONEERING THAT  
POD1000000014_S0000196 ONE THING BEYOND THAT TOO   ROB   IS THAT AH  
POD1000000014_S0000197 SINCE THE REVIEW WAS UNDERTAKEN   THE I O I   ALONG WITH OTHER BODIES   HAVE WORKED QUITE HARD  
POD1000000014_S0000198 WHAT THE VENICE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN DEVELOPING A SET OF OVERRIDING PRINCIPLES FOR OMBUDSMAN OFFICES   THE VENICE PRINCIPLES   AS THEY'VE BECOME KNOWN  
POD1000000014_S0000199 AND THEY'VE NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE  
POD1000000014_S0000200 AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A PROPER INTERNATIONAL STANDARD AGAINST WHICH OMBUDS OFFICES CAN BE JUDGED  
POD1000000014_S0000201 AND SO   I'M KEEN TO SEE THEM BEING USED   AS THEY ARE BEING USED NOW   IN THE CONTEXT OF PEER REVIEW  
POD1000000014_S0000202 SO THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE SET OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED STANDARDS AGAINST WHICH YOU'RE MEASURING A PARTICULAR OMBUDSMAN OFFICE  
POD1000000014_S0000203 SO I THINK THAT'S AGAIN MARKS ANOTHER STEP FORWARD AND ONE THAT I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE SEEN DEVELOP  
POD1000000014_S0000204 I THINK   WHEN I UNDERTOOK THE PEER REVIEW OF THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN WITH MY BELGIAN COUNTERPART  
POD1000000014_S0000205 WE USED THOSE VERY SAME VENICE PRINCIPLES AS THE BENCHMARK AGAINST WHICH TO JUDGE THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000206 AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT   BECAUSE IT'S WITHOUT PREJUDICE  
POD1000000014_S0000207 IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE   SO I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT  
POD1000000014_S0000208 SO TWO FINAL QUESTIONS   HOW HAVE YOU   PETER TYNDALL   REACTED TO WORKING REMOTELY   BEING AT HOME WITH YOUR FAMILY  
POD1000000014_S0000209 I'VE ENJOYED IT   TO BE HONEST  
POD1000000014_S0000210 IT HASN'T BEEN TOO FRUSTRATING   THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE AN ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME   BUT IT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO DIFFICULT  
POD1000000014_S0000211 IT IT'S BEEN LESS DIFFICULT THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED  
POD1000000014_S0000212 DOES TIME GOES ON   I THINK THE ISSUE OF VISIBLE LEADERSHIP COMES INTO IT   DOESN'T IT  
POD1000000014_S0000213 SO YOU KNOW   YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO TO BE WITH YOUR PEOPLE AGAIN   BUT   BUT IT WORKS SURPRISINGLY WELL  
POD1000000014_S0000214 AND  
POD1000000014_S0000215 AS I SAY   I THINK FOR THE OFFICE ITSELF   I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE REMOTE WORKING IN THE FUTURE  
POD1000000014_S0000216 THANK YOU   SO LASTLY   THEN   IT'S WHAT I ALWAYS ASK MY GUESTS  
POD1000000014_S0000217 WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUNG COLLEAGUES NEWLY ARRIVING AS CASEWORKERS IN THE EMBRYONIC OMBUDSMAN PROFESSION  
POD1000000014_S0000218 FOR ME   THERE IS UM   THERE IS A COUPLE OF CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE TO BE EMBODIED BY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SERVICE OR AS AN OMBUDSMAN  
POD1000000014_S0000219 WE HAVE TO BE OBJECTIVE   WE HAVE TO BE FAIR  
POD1000000014_S0000220 WE HAVE TO BE EVEN HANDED   SO THE FIRST ADVICE OFTEN IS   MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY BEFORE YOU REACH YOUR CONCLUSION  
POD1000000014_S0000221 BUT UNDERPINNING ALL OF THAT I WOULD SAY THAT   IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE   THEN YOU'RE IN THE WRONG JOB  
POD1000000014_S0000222 BECAUSE WHAT THIS FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT IS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS   PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE   AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY IS DENIED ACCESS TO JUSTICE  
POD1000000014_S0000223 AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR  
POD1000000014_S0000224 THANK YOU SO MUCH   PETER  
POD1000000014_S0000225 YOUR ANSWERS WERE STIMULATING   AND ALSO INSPIRATIONAL  
POD1000000014_S0000227 WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME YOU'VE GIVEN FOR THIS INTERVIEW  
POD1000000014_S0000228 THANKS A LOT  
POD1000000014_S0000230 MY NEXT GUEST WILL BE THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN   RAFAEL RIBO  
POD1000000014_S0000231 SO HE'LL BE JOINING US FROM BARCELONA  
POD1000000014_S0000232 IN THE MEANTIME   IT'S ROB BEHRENS ON BEHALF OF RADIO OMBUDSMAN   SAYING   HAVE A GOOD DAY AND STAY SAFE  
POD1000000017_S0000001 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE   I'M NIKOLE HANNAH JONES   THIS IS SIXTEEN NINETEEN  
POD1000000017_S0000003 THIS WEEK   WESLEY MORRIS ON THE BIRTH OF AMERICAN MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000005 SO LAST FALL   I AM AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE   WE ARE MAKING DINNER   I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES   AND I ASKED MY FRIEND BRETT   WHO WAS COOKING WITH ME   CAN YOU PUT ON SOME MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000006 AND HE SAID   WHAT DO YOU WANNA LISTEN TO   AND I SAID   HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF YACHT ROCK   AND HE SAID   WHAT   I SAID   YACHT ROCK   HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS   AND HE GOES   NO   I HAVE NOT  
POD1000000017_S0000007 SO HE FINDS THE YACHT ROCK STATION IN PANDORA   WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHY OR HOW HE'S STILL A PANDORA GUY   WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO PANDORA   HE IS ONE   AND HE FINDS THE YACHT ROCK STATION  
POD1000000017_S0000009 AT SOME POINT   BRETT HAS TO GO RUN AN ERRAND   I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM ON ONE   I DON'T REMEMBER   BUT HE'S GONE   SO I'M ALONE   JUST ME   WITH THE VEGETABLES AND THE YACHT ROCK  
POD1000000017_S0000011 IT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE SONGS I'M HEARING  
POD1000000017_S0000013 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MUSIC MADE BETWEEN THE YEARS OF   I DON'T KNOW   I WOULD SAY   LIKE   NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE   THINGS LIKE  
POD1000000017_S0000015 ACES   HOW LONG  
POD1000000017_S0000017 SEALS AND CROFTS   TO DOING SUMMER BREEZE   I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE  
POD1000000017_S0000019 STEAL AWAY BY ROBBIE DUPREE  
POD1000000017_S0000021 AND THE DOOBIE BROTHERS   WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES  
POD1000000017_S0000023 IT IS LIKE OUR SOFT ROCK EST PERIOD IN AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000025 THE JOKE OF YACHT ROCK IS THAT WHOEVER INVENTED IT   WHOEVER'S MAKING A PLAYLIST OUT OF THESE SONGS   IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT THEY'RE INCONSEQUENTIAL AND THAT WHAT'S IN THEM DOESN'T MATTER  
POD1000000017_S0000027 BUT WHAT I KNOW I'M HEARING IS SOMETHING BIGGER AND DEEPER THAN THAT  
POD1000000017_S0000029 EVERY SONG HAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE OTHER SONGS  
POD1000000017_S0000031 I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANNA BY TOTO  
POD1000000017_S0000033 WHICH SEEMS PERFECTLY BANAL   HAS A REALLY GOOD BEAT   SORT OF BUILDS TO ITS CHORUS  
POD1000000017_S0000035 BUT THEN AT THE END  
POD1000000017_S0000037 I'M HEARING  
POD1000000017_S0000039 THE GREAT DOO WOP HARMONIES OF THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES  
POD1000000017_S0000041 THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN  
POD1000000017_S0000043 YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD  
POD1000000017_S0000045 THAT IS LIKE A GOSPEL BREAKDOWN  
POD1000000017_S0000047 WHAT I'M HEARING IN ALL OF THESE SONGS IS   BASICALLY   BLACKNESS  
POD1000000017_S0000049 AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST   AND STRONGEST   AND MOST POWERFULLY   AT LEAST TO ME   STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN   CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES   WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS'S THIS IS IT COMES ON  
POD1000000017_S0000051 IT'S GOT A KIND OF LOOSELY DISCO LIKE RHYTHM TO IT   THERE'S A LOT OF PERCUSSION SORT OF GOING BACK AND FORTH AND AROUND  
POD1000000017_S0000053 SURE   KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING WHISPERING THE VERSES IN THIS SONG  
POD1000000017_S0000055 DOING THIS VERY LIGHT  
POD1000000017_S0000056 COOL  
POD1000000017_S0000058 AND THEN IN THE PRE CHORUS   KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS   AND WHO SHOWS UP   MICHAEL MCDONALD  
POD1000000017_S0000060 GIVING KENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF  
POD1000000017_S0000062 WHEN HE SINGS THE WORD MIRACLE   HE DOESN'T SING   MIRACLE   HE GOES   MIRACLE  
POD1000000017_S0000064 LIKE HE IS SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF A PAN TO GET ALL OF THE GOOD BITS OFF OF IT BEFORE YOU POUR THE GRAVY IN  
POD1000000017_S0000066 SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER   AND HERE IS KENNY LOGGINS   AS THIS WHITE ARTIST   DOING IT  
POD1000000017_S0000068 AND THEN THE GRAVY COMES  
POD1000000017_S0000070 HE IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF THE CHURCH AT THIS POINT  
POD1000000017_S0000071 HE HAS ELEVATED HIMSELF TO THE RAFTERS   THERE'S LIKE NO MORE HE IS LIKE AT THE ROOF   TRYING TO CLEAR A WAY TO GET TO HEAVEN   BUT THERE'S JUST CHURCH ROOF IN THE WAY  
POD1000000017_S0000073 HE'S NOT THE GREATEST SINGER   BUT THERE'S A KIND OF GUMPTION AND NERVE TO THE SINGING OF THIS SONG  
POD1000000017_S0000075 THAT CANNOT BE DENIED   A TIP OF THE HAT TO HIM  
POD1000000017_S0000076 I JUST HAD TO STAND THERE   AND I JUST I I I ACTUALLY CRACKED UP   I I JUST PUT DOWN THE KNIFE   AND I CRACKED UP   AND IT FELT SO PLEASURABLE   AND THEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER SINGERS I LOVE  
POD1000000017_S0000078 I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WINEHOUSE  
POD1000000017_S0000080 I'M THINKING ABOUT ANNIE LENNOX  
POD1000000017_S0000082 I'M THINKING ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL  
POD1000000017_S0000084 I THINK ABOUT CHRIS STAPLETON  
POD1000000017_S0000085 YOU PRACTICES THIS KIND OF MUSCLY BLUES THAT GETS WRITTEN OFF AS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE'S A BIG WHITE GUY IN A HAT  
POD1000000017_S0000087 AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOUL MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000089 THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA   BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA   IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN   ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNIE LENNOX AND AMY WINEHOUSE  
POD1000000017_S0000090 AND IT FILLS ME WITH PRIDE   LIKE   I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE AND ULTIMATELY INEVITABLE ABOUT BLACK MUSIC BEING A PART OF AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000091 BUT IT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT THERE'S A HISTORY TO THIS   A VERY PAINFUL HISTORY   AND IN THE MOST PERVERSELY IRONIC WAY   IT'S THIS HISTORICAL PAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000093 SOME OF THE OLDEST RECORDINGS WE HAVE OF BLACK AMERICAN MUSIC ARE FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES  
POD1000000017_S0000094 AND THEY'RE SONGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUNG BY AMERICANS BORN INTO SLAVERY   THERE'S THIS ONE CALLED OLD SHIP OF ZION  
POD1000000017_S0000095 YOU CAN HEAR IN IT THESE FOUR MEN   THEIR VOICES ARE MOVING IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER  
POD1000000017_S0000097 AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL   AND IT'S ALSO SAD   YOU CAN FEEL THAT IN YOUR BONES  
POD1000000017_S0000098 AND THEN THERE'LL BE MUSIC THAT WAS COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE   LIKE OLD COON DOG   FOR INSTANCE  
POD1000000017_S0000100 YOU CAN HEAR THE PLAYFULNESS IN THE SONG  
POD1000000017_S0000102 AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BANJO   THIS GREAT AFRICAN INSTRUMENT THAT BECOMES THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN MUSIC IN SO MANY WAYS   AND THAT THING IS DANCING  
POD1000000017_S0000103 AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCREA  
POD1000000017_S0000104 AND OH   MY GOD   YOU CAN HEAR IN HIS SINGING WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL SOMETHING LIKE THE LIVELONG DAY  
POD1000000017_S0000106 YEARS AND YEARS OF HARD WORK  
POD1000000017_S0000107 AND UNIMAGINABLE SORROW  
POD1000000017_S0000109 YOU CAN ALSO HEAR IN ALL OF THIS MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000111 THIS UNDENIABLE SOUND OF HOPE  
POD1000000017_S0000113 ALL OF THESE MELODIES AND CADENCES AND EMOTIONS ARE THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE PASSED DOWN GENERATION AFTER GENERATION   IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ON A PLANTATION   IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD WALKING BY A PLANTATION  
POD1000000017_S0000114 IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB   ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK   THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES  
POD1000000017_S0000115 AS THE STORY GOES   T D RICE   A WHITE MAN   THIS ANONYMOUS NOBODY ACTOR TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET  
POD1000000017_S0000116 ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROUPE IN CINCINNATI   OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH   WE DON'T REALLY KNOW   BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES   T D RICE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE  
POD1000000017_S0000117 THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW  
POD1000000017_S0000119 HE HEARD THE TUNE THIS OLD BLACK MAN WAS SINGING   HE SAW THE WAY THIS MAN MOVED HIS BODY AS HE WAS CLEANING THIS HORSE  
POD1000000017_S0000120 NOW   WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TUNE THIS OLD MAN WOULD'VE BEEN SINGING  
POD1000000017_S0000122 WHATEVER RICE HEARS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM   AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY  
POD1000000017_S0000124 BECAUSE SHOWBIZ IN THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES LOOKED LIKE THIS  
POD1000000017_S0000126 ITALIAN OPERAS  
POD1000000017_S0000128 BRITISH PLAYS   ENTERTAINMENT IMPORTED FROM EUROPE   ALL THE PEOPLE PERFORMING THIS STUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE   THE AUDIENCES WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE  
POD1000000017_S0000129 AFTER ALL   IT'S EIGHTEEN THIRTY   SLAVERY IS IN FULL EFFECT  
POD1000000017_S0000131 AND WHEN IT CAME TO ENTERTAINMENT   THERE WAS NOTHING NEW   NOTHING TRULY AMERICAN  
POD1000000017_S0000133 AND SO WHEN T D RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY   DING   A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF  
POD1000000017_S0000134 AND HE TAKES THAT LIGHT BULB AND RUNS ALL THE WAY TO THE THEATER   HE FIGURES OUT A WAY TO MELT DOWN SOME CORK  
POD1000000017_S0000135 LET'S IT COOL   PRESUMABLY TAKES A RAG   OR MAYBE EVEN HIS HAND IF IT'S COOL ENOUGH  
POD1000000017_S0000137 AND THEN HE PAINTS HIS FACE BLACK  
POD1000000017_S0000139 HE GOES OUT ON STAGE   BUT INSTEAD OF DOING HIS REGULAR ACT   HE'S GOT THIS HORSE GROOMER'S TUNE   EXCEPT NOW   HE'S GIVEN THE TUNE LYRICS  
POD1000000017_S0000140 COME LISTEN   ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS   I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE   I'M GOING TO SING A LITTLE SONG   MY NAME'S JIM CROW  
POD1000000017_S0000142 AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME   AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW  
POD1000000017_S0000144 SO THE CROWD GOES CRAZY   THEY GO SO BANANAS   THE MAN GETS TWENTY ENCORES  
POD1000000017_S0000146 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE   THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA   THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM  
POD1000000017_S0000147 AND THIS IS WHAT AMERICA REALLY WANTED   WHICH WAS ITS OWN ORIGINAL ART FORM THAT IS NOT AN ITALIAN OPERA   AND ISN'T SOME BRITISH GUY COMING OVER AND THESPIANING ALL OVER THEM  
POD1000000017_S0000148 AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM   THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN  
POD1000000017_S0000150 OH   BOY   I MEAN   YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES   THIS SENSATIONAL THING HAPPENS   AND THEN EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET ON THE BANDWAGON AND DO THEIR OWN  
POD1000000017_S0000151 SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE  
POD1000000017_S0000152 AND A BLACK FACE ON THEIR WHITE SKIN  
POD1000000017_S0000154 AND THEN FROM THESE SOLO ACTS   YOU HAVE   BASICALLY   BANDS FORMING  
POD1000000017_S0000156 AND THE BANDS HAVE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN A BAND THAT YOU'D RECOGNIZE NOW   THERE IS A BANJO AND A FIDDLE AND SOME TAMBOURINES   AND PERCUSSION IN THE FORM OF BONES   WHICH WOULD COME FROM A PIG SOMETIMES  
POD1000000017_S0000157 THAT IS THE FORMATION OF WHAT WILL BECOME THE MINSTREL TROUPE  
POD1000000017_S0000159 AND THE PLACE THAT MINSTRELSY TOOK HOLD WAS IN THE NORTH  
POD1000000017_S0000160 PLACES LIKE PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK AND BOSTON   WHERE YOU'D HAVE THESE THEATERS DEDICATED TO MINSTREL ACTS   WHERE MINSTREL ACTS WOULD JUST MOVE INTO A THEATER AND DO THEIR ACT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT  
POD1000000017_S0000161 AND A LOT OF THESE PERFORMERS HAD NEVER BEEN MEANINGFULLY SOUTH TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACK PEOPLE   AND SO THEY JUST MADE STUFF UP   BASED ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT BLACK PEOPLE WERE LIKE  
POD1000000017_S0000163 THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW ON THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO AMERICA FROM OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE   LIKE THE POLKA  
POD1000000017_S0000165 AND SO YOU WOULD HAD   OVER THE COURSE OF THE FORMATION OF THIS CULTURE   AN INHERENT MIXING   YOU HAD SOME AMAZING MIX OF AN IMAGINED BLACKNESS  
POD1000000017_S0000166 REAL   ACTUAL IRISH MELODIES   AND POLISH MUSIC   WITH WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL GOSPEL   BUT SPIRITUAL HARMONIES   INTERLACED TOGETHER WITH THIS AFRICAN BANJO  
POD1000000017_S0000168 BASICALLY WELDING INTO A FUSION THAT BECOMES THE THING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO TRY TO DO  
POD1000000017_S0000170 THE WHOLE THING JUST SWEEPS THE NATION   AND FOR THE REST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   THIS IS THE SHIT   CAN WE SAY THAT  
POD1000000017_S0000172 AND SO   FOR THE REST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   THIS IS THE SHIT  
POD1000000017_S0000174 THIS IS AMERICA'S PRIMARY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT   PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY FOR BLACKFACE MINSTRELS   YOU HAVE LITTLE BOYS GOING TO BED AND DREAMING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BECOME PART OF THIS MINSTREL SHOW  
POD1000000017_S0000175 SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER  
POD1000000017_S0000177 STEPHEN FOSTER   THE MAN WIDELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000179 SOME OF HIS SONGS   SOME OF HIS MOST FAMOUS SONGS   SONGS YOU KNOW   SONGS YOU LOVE   SONGS YOU STILL SING   SONGS YOUR CHILDREN   IF YOU HAVE THEM   THEY STILL SING   SOME OF THOSE SONGS WERE WRITTEN FOR BLACKFACE PERFORMERS  
POD1000000017_S0000181 AND IF YOU LISTEN TO SOMETHING LIKE CAMPTOWN RACES   YOU CAN HEAR IN IT ALL OF ITS MINSTREL PROPERTIES  
POD1000000017_S0000183 THE SONG   OF COURSE   IS WRITTEN IN SO CALLED NEGRO DIALECT   I MEAN   INSTEAD OF SAYING GOING   YOU'RE SAYING GWINE  
POD1000000017_S0000185 LIKE   INSTEAD OF SAYING   O F FOR OF   YOU GET A LOT OF D E FOR DE   THIS IS A WHITE PERSON IMAGINING HOW A BLACK PERSON WOULD SING THIS SONG  
POD1000000017_S0000187 THIS IS A WHITE PERSON IMAGINING HOW A BLACK PERSON WOULD SING THIS SONG  
POD1000000017_S0000188 AND THAT WAS A GOLD RUSH ERA HIT  
POD1000000017_S0000190 THIS IS THE I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE  
POD1000000017_S0000192 PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE STILL LIVE WITH NOW IS THAT IT WAS SO MUCH THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICAN CULTURE THAT IT WASN'T THAT IT BECAME NOT RACIST  
POD1000000017_S0000193 IT JUST WAS A THING THAT YOU DID   IF YOU WANTED TO BE AN ENTERTAINER AT ANY POINT AFTER EIGHTEEN THIRTY   YOU   IN ALL LIKELIHOOD   WERE AT LEAST GONNA TRY TO BE A BLACKFACE MINSTREL   EVEN IF YOU WERE BLACK  
POD1000000017_S0000195 AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS   AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO PERFORM   THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THE NATION WANTS   AND WHAT THE NATION WANTS AT THAT POINT IS BLACKFACE  
POD1000000017_S0000196 AND NOW   GIVING YOU NOISE IN TEMPO  
POD1000000017_S0000197 F E MILLER AND SCATMAN CROTHERS  
POD1000000017_S0000198 SO BLACK PEOPLE BLACKED UP AND PERFORMED AS BLACK PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T ACTUALLY BLACK  
POD1000000017_S0000200 BY THE TIME YOU HAVE BLACK PEOPLE PAINTING THEIR FACES BLACK TO PERFORM AS BLACK PEOPLE   THE ONLY QUESTION YOU CAN REALLY ASK AT THIS POINT IS   WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON   WHY IS THIS HAPPENING  
POD1000000017_S0000201 WHAT WAS SO CAPTIVATING ABOUT SEEING BLACK PEOPLE REPRESENTED THIS WAY   WHY WOULD A WHITE AUDIENCE HAVE CLAMORED FOR IT SO MUCH   I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT OFFERED WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT A THING THAT ACTUALLY FELT REALLY BAD AT THE TIME  
POD1000000017_S0000202 PEOPLE WERE REALLY TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH SLAVERY OR WHETHER TO ABOLISH IT   THE MINSTREL SHOW DIDN'T REALLY GIVE YOU AN ANSWER  
POD1000000017_S0000203 BUT IT PROVIDED A PLATFORM BY WHICH YOU COULD EITHER ESCAPE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION THAT REALLY WAS TEARING THE NATION APART   OR DEPENDING ON WHICH SHOW YOU WOULD WIND UP SEEING  
POD1000000017_S0000204 IT FULLY ENGAGED YOU IN THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE WAY ABOUT ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND HOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM   BECAUSE THEY LIKE BEING ENSLAVED   YOU GOT TO LAUGH AT A THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY FELT SO ANGUISHED ABOUT  
POD1000000017_S0000205 YOU GET TO WATCH THESE BLACK PEOPLE   WHO ARE REALLY A SOURCE OF NATIONAL AGONY OUTSIDE THE THEATER   BECOME FOOLS INSIDE THE THEATER   AND IN SITTING IN THAT THEATER   WATCHING THESE WHITE MEN IN BLACKFACE MAKE FOOLS OF BLACK PEOPLE  
POD1000000017_S0000206 A WHITE AUDIENCE COULD FEEL CULTURED   THEY COULD FEEL CIVILIZED   THEY COULD FEEL SUPERIOR TO THE PEOPLE THEY WERE WATCHING BE MADE FUN OF  
POD1000000017_S0000207 AND IN A CRAZY WAY   WATCHING THEM DEHUMANIZE WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WHITE AUDIENCE TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT THEIR OWN HUMANITY  
POD1000000017_S0000209 BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY   MINSTRELSY IS STILL WITH US   IT IS THE BASIS UPON WHICH AMERICAN MOVIES ARE BUILT   THIS COUNTRY'S FIRST MOVIE BLOCKBUSTER  
POD1000000017_S0000210 D W GRIFFITH'S THE BIRTH OF A NATION   FULL OF WHITE MEN VILLAINOUSLY IN BLACKFACE  
POD1000000017_S0000212 AND AMERICA'S FIRST TALKING MOTION PICTURE  
POD1000000017_S0000214 THE JAZZ SINGER   ABOUT A JEWISH MAN WHO FEELS MOST HIMSELF NOT AS A JEWISH MAN STRUGGLING WITH HIS JEWISH IDENTITY AND PLEASING HIS CANTOR FATHER   NO   NO  
POD1000000017_S0000216 IT'S WHEN HE BLACKS HIS FACE UP AND PERFORMS MAMMY AS A NEGRO  
POD1000000017_S0000218 SOME OF AMERICAN'S FAVORITE STARS DID NUMBERS IN BLACKFACE  
POD1000000017_S0000220 JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE  
POD1000000017_S0000222 BING CROSBY AND FRED ASTAIRE BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE  
POD1000000017_S0000224 WHITE CHRISTMAS HAS A WHOLE NUMBER   MOST FAMOUS NUMBER IN WHITE CHRISTMAS INVOLVES A BLACKFACE TUNE  
POD1000000017_S0000226 BUT AT THE SAME TIME   THERE'S THE BEGINNINGS OF A RECORDING INDUSTRY   AND YOU HAD BLACK ARTISTS WHO HAD ACCESS TO RECORDING STUDIOS  
POD1000000017_S0000227 OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS   YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS  
POD1000000017_S0000229 INVENTING AND PERFECTING BLUES RHYTHM   BLUES IDEAS   BLUES EXPRESSION   THE EXPRESSION OF  
POD1000000017_S0000231 OF A FULLY HUMAN BLACK SELF IN AMERICAN POPULAR ART  
POD1000000017_S0000233 HE HAD A KIND OF CONFIDENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD COMING FROM A BLACK PERSON BEFORE  
POD1000000017_S0000235 AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING  
POD1000000017_S0000237 YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS   WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD   PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHET  
POD1000000017_S0000239 AND THEN LOUIS ARMSTRONG  
POD1000000017_S0000241 AND DUKE ELLINGTON  
POD1000000017_S0000243 YOU HAVE BLACK MUSICIANS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MOVE NOT ONLY MUSIC FORWARD   BUT AMERICAN CULTURE FORWARD  
POD1000000017_S0000245 THINKING ABOUT HOW THESE INSTRUMENTS CAN DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES MAKE WHAT WE THINK OF AS WESTERN EUROPEAN CLASSICAL MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000247 AND TAKING MUSIC TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAD EVER TRIED TO PREVIOUSLY TAKE IT  
POD1000000017_S0000249 PEOPLE WHO JUST KEPT PUSHING IT FORWARD AND BEYOND  
POD1000000017_S0000251 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MOVEMENT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE EVER HAD ARTISTICALLY  
POD1000000017_S0000253 AND THAT IS THE ADVENT OF MOTOWN RECORDS  
POD1000000017_S0000255 MOTOWN IS THE MOST POWERFUL MASS PRODUCED EXPRESSION OF BLACK GLAMOUR   OF BLACK SELF CONFIDENCE   OF BLACK SELF RELIANCE  
POD1000000017_S0000257 ITS PROJECT WAS TO GET BLACK PRODUCERS   BLACK MUSICIANS   BLACK SINGERS TO TAKE   QUOTE   WHITE   QUOTE   WESTERN MUSICAL IDEAS OF ORCHESTRATION   STRINGS AND HORNS  
POD1000000017_S0000259 AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HARMONIES  
POD1000000017_S0000261 AND YOU MARRY THEM TO A BLACK WEEKEND  
POD1000000017_S0000263 WHERE ON SATURDAY NIGHT   YOU'RE AT A JUKE JOINT   HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH RHYTHM AND BLUES MUSIC   GUITAR AND DRUM AND BASS  
POD1000000017_S0000265 SEX   BASICALLY  
POD1000000017_S0000267 AND THEN YOU GO HOME   SLIGHTLY HUNG OVER  
POD1000000017_S0000269 AND YOU WAKE UP   AND YOU GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING  
POD1000000017_S0000271 WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER MUSICAL EXPERIENCE INVOLVING HAND CLAPS   AND DIFFERENT HARMONIC ARRANGEMENTS   AND CALL AND RESPONSE  
POD1000000017_S0000273 A LOT OF FEELING   A LOT OF OOMPH   A LOT OF GRATITUDE  
POD1000000017_S0000275 YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE DIFFERENT AREAS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE MOTOWN RECORD  
POD1000000017_S0000277 OR WHETHER IT'S THE FOUR TOPS DOING REACH OUT I'LL BE THERE  
POD1000000017_S0000279 OR MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS DOING HEAT WAVE  
POD1000000017_S0000281 ON SOMETHING LIKE HEAT WAVE   YOU CAN HEAR HANDS SLAPPING THE TAMBOURINE LIKE IT ACTUALLY IS SUNDAY MORNING  
POD1000000017_S0000283 THEN WHEN EVERYTHING IS FIRING  
POD1000000017_S0000285 IT'S JUST THE MOST EXCITING   ROMANTIC SOUND YOU'RE YOU'RE EVER GONNA HEAR   AND AT THE CENTER OF IT IS WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A REFULGENT   TASTEFUL BLACKNESS  
POD1000000017_S0000287 HERE YOU HAVE IN MOTOWN A FORCE THAT IS ACTIVELY COMBATING THESE IDEAS OF BLACK PEOPLE AS BEING INHERENTLY INFERIOR  
POD1000000017_S0000289 MOTOWN IS THE ANTIDOTE TO AMERICAN MINSTRELSY  
POD1000000017_S0000291 AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT STANDING THERE IN THAT KITCHEN   CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES   IT'S THE THING THAT MADE ME LAUGH WAS JUST HOW ALL THAT HISTORY  
POD1000000017_S0000292 IS JUST VERY SILENTLY COURSING THROUGH THIS MUSIC   IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT IT'S EVEN THERE   IT'S SO THOROUGHLY ATOMIZED INTO AMERICAN CULTURE   IT'S GONNA SHOW UP IN A WAY THAT EVEN PEOPLE MAKING THE ART CAN'T QUITE PUT THEIR FINGER ON  
POD1000000017_S0000294 WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN BLACK MUSIC THAT'S SO APPEALING TO SO MANY PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACROSS TIME IS POSSIBILITY   STRUGGLE   IT IS STRIFE   IT IS HUMOR  
POD1000000017_S0000295 IT IS SEX   IT IS CONFIDENCE   AND THAT'S IRONIC   BECAUSE THIS IS THE SOUND OF A PEOPLE WHO   FOR DECADES AND CENTURIES   HAVE BEEN DENIED FREEDOM  
POD1000000017_S0000296 AND YET WHAT YOU RESPOND TO IN BLACK MUSIC IS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF A BELIEF IN THAT FREEDOM   THE BELIEF THAT THE STRUGGLE IS WORTH IT   THAT THE PAIN BEGETS JOY  
POD1000000017_S0000297 AND THAT THAT JOY YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS NOT ONLY CONTAGIOUS   IT'S NECESSARY AND URGENT AND IRRESISTIBLE   BLACK MUSIC IS AMERICAN MUSIC  
POD1000000017_S0000298 BECAUSE AS AMERICANS   WE SAY WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM   AND THAT'S WHAT WE TELL THE WORLD   AND THE POWER OF BLACK MUSIC IS THAT IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THAT BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN FREEDOM  
POD1000000018_S0000000 WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE   C N N COVERED HIS DEATH OFF AND ON THE ENTIRE DAY  
POD1000000018_S0000001 YOU'VE ALL SEEN THIS TYPE OF NEWS COVERAGE BEFORE   AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAREER   IMAGES OF THE STAR IN THEIR PRIME   PHONE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO WERE CLOSE WITH THE DEPARTED  
POD1000000018_S0000003 LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY   HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES   AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING  
POD1000000018_S0000005 WHAT LARRY SAID   IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK  
POD1000000018_S0000007 THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE   EVEN TODAY   BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK  
POD1000000018_S0000009 HOWEVER   IN TWENTY FIFTEEN   THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT   THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN  
POD1000000018_S0000010 A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY FROM HOUSTON   TEXAS WHO LOST ONLY FIFTY THREE OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES WHERE CLIENTS OF HIS FACED THE DEATH PENALTY   WITH ONLY ONE OF THOSE LOSSES RESULTING IN AN ACTUAL EXECUTION  
POD1000000018_S0000012 PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER   NO DENYING IT   BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT  
POD1000000018_S0000014 SO   INSTEAD OF ONE JUDGE   WHO'S HEARD IT ALL BEFORE   DETERMINING HIS CLIENT'S FATE  
POD1000000018_S0000016 PERCY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE   WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL  
POD1000000018_S0000017 THEY WERE UP TO NO GOOD   THE COMMUNITY WAS FAR BETTER OFF WITHOUT THAT ELEMENT IN IT   AND EVEN IF HIS CLIENT HAD KILLED THEM WELL   HELL   THEY HATED KILLING  
POD1000000018_S0000019 FOREMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER   THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME  
POD1000000018_S0000020 OFTEN NOTHING MORE THAN PROBATION   NO TIME   AT ALL   IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SANCTIONED FORM OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE  
POD1000000018_S0000021 PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY   PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE  
POD1000000018_S0000023 NOW   JIM DENNY   WASN'T FROM TEXAS   HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE  
POD1000000018_S0000024 THE BUFFALO VALLEY AREA   ABOUT SIXTY MILES EAST OF NASHVILLE   WAS A REAL POOR AREA TO BE BORN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN  
POD1000000018_S0000025 WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIM DENNY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAILROOM OF W S M RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY   HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF  
POD1000000018_S0000027 DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN   THAT YEAR   THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM W S M BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME   ON AIR  
POD1000000018_S0000029 EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY   JIM WOULD TAKE IT   SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE   SEE THE ARTISTS   AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE  
POD1000000018_S0000030 WITHIN TWENTY YEARS   DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTISTS SERVICE BUREAU AT W S M   WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE ACTS ON THE OPRY  
POD1000000018_S0000032 THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY   LIKE   THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT  
POD1000000018_S0000033 ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY  
POD1000000018_S0000035 IT DIDN'T GO WELL   DENNY IS RUMORED WHO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE   YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE   SON   YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO DRIVING A TRUCK  
POD1000000018_S0000037 DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS   OVER THE TELEPHONE   AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY  
POD1000000018_S0000039 CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN  
POD1000000018_S0000041 JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN   TODAY   I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM   AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN  
POD1000000018_S0000043 YOU ARE LISTENING TO COCAINE AND RHINESTONE   THE PODCAST ABOUT TWENTY CENTURY COUNTRY MUSIC   AND THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO GIVE IT TO US

POD1000000018_S0000047 IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TUBB'S NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE   WHATSOEVER  
POD1000000018_S0000049 THERE ARE PLENTY OF STORIES ABOUT HIM BUT MOST OF THEM ARE ABOUT HOW GREAT A GUY HE WAS   HE HAD AN ADORABLE NICKNAME E T   YOU CAN HEAR ADMIRATION IN THE VOICE OF EVERYONE WHO CALLS HIM THAT  
POD1000000018_S0000051 CRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW   ERNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS   LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS CHILDREN   ERNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA

POD1000000018_S0000054 LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WE'LL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES   IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ERNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMIE RODGERS SING  
POD1000000018_S0000056 THE OBSESSION WITH INSTANT AND IT WOULD STEER THE COURSE OF THE REST OF HIS LIFE  
POD1000000018_S0000058 HEARING JIMMIE RODGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUBB TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER  
POD1000000018_S0000059 IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM   THREE DECADES LATER   TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNY  
POD1000000018_S0000061 IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE   JIMMIE RODGERS DIED YOUNG OF TUBERCULOSIS SYMPTOMS   HE WAS THIRTY FIVE  
POD1000000018_S0000062 THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR ERNEST   HOWEVER   IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS  
POD1000000018_S0000063 HE MOVED TO SAN ANTONIO   MADE A FEW GUEST APPEARANCES ON A FRIEND'S RADIO SHOW AND MANAGED TO SECURE HIS OWN EARLY MORNING SHOW   WHICH AIRED TWICE A WEEK   NOT BAD FOR A NINETEEN YEAR OLD KID  
POD1000000018_S0000064 BUT DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA   HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE BIG TIME   AND THE PAY WAS QUITE SLIM  
POD1000000018_S0000066 E T HAD TO KEEP TWO OTHER JOBS BESIDES THE RADIO GIG   SOME DAYS   HE WAS A DITCH DIGGER   IN OTHER DAYS   A DRUG STORE CLERK  
POD1000000018_S0000067 HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE   ELAINE   THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS   EITHER  
POD1000000018_S0000069 ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARD THE LIFE OF HIS HERO   JIMMIE RODGERS  
POD1000000018_S0000070 HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMIE FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE   SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMIE RODGER'S WIDOW   CARRIE  
POD1000000018_S0000071 HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER   BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMIE THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE   MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED  
POD1000000018_S0000072 CARRIE WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE   AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN KERRVILLE TEXAS   TO GET THE PICTURE  
POD1000000018_S0000073 ERNEST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING   TAKING ELAINE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP  
POD1000000018_S0000075 THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE TEN MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES   GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS   RODGERS   HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER  
POD1000000018_S0000076 E T COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT HAVING HELD JIMMIE RODGERS SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMIE'S NAME INLAID IN PEARL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK   UPSIDE DOWN  
POD1000000018_S0000077 SO HE COULD FLIP IT OVER TO SHOW AUDIENCES  
POD1000000018_S0000079 CHOOSE YOUR BIGGEST DEAD HERO AND TRY TO THINK OF HOW YOU'D FEEL IF A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE HAPPENED TO YOU   IT'S MIND BLOWING  
POD1000000018_S0000080 OKAY   NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT   A FEW MONTHS LATER   CARRIE RODGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO  
POD1000000018_S0000081 ON ONE HAND   SHE OFFERED TO HELP E T OUT WITH THE ACCESS SHE STILL HAD TO MUSIC BUSINESS BIG SHOTS  
POD1000000018_S0000082 ON THE OTHER HAND   SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMIE RODGERS WHEN HE SANG   WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD ERNEST TUBB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE  
POD1000000018_S0000083 AND EVERYONE AROUND HIM HAD TOLD HIM THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'D BEEN DOING THE WHOLE TIME  
POD1000000018_S0000085 ANYWAY   SHE STILL HOOKED E T UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS   THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMIE RODGERS SONGS  
POD1000000018_S0000086 ERNEST TUBB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL   DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME   DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE   DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM  
POD1000000018_S0000088 AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME   ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT   HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODEL FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN  
POD1000000018_S0000089 JUMPING RIGHT BACK INTO HIS NORMAL ROUTINE RE INJURED HIS THROAT  
POD1000000018_S0000091 IT CHANGED HIS VOICE FOREVER  
POD1000000018_S0000093 ERNEST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE   HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING BETTER THAN HE COULD  
POD1000000018_S0000094 I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT   IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME   I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY   THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY   IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBB'S NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER  
POD1000000018_S0000096 YOU JUST HEARD SOME ERNEST   HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM NINETEEN FORTY TWO  
POD1000000018_S0000098 NOW   GEORGE JUNDE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HANK WILLIAMS WAS HIS FAVORITE SINGER YOU DON'T GET HANK WITHOUT ERNEST AND ROY   I'VE SEEN LEFTY FRIZZELL NAMED AS AN INFLUENCE ON GEORGE  
POD1000000018_S0000099 LEFTY BORROWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL   HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES   IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB  
POD1000000018_S0000100 NOW   THE PART OF ERNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT   PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME  
POD1000000018_S0000101 NO MATTER IF IT'S A SONG YOU'VE HEARD PERFORMED BY OTHER PEOPLE  
POD1000000018_S0000102 HERE'S GEORGIA IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX DOING HIS OWN COMPOSITION   JUST ONE MORE  
POD1000000018_S0000104 BOTH VERSIONS OF THIS SONG ARE GREAT  
POD1000000018_S0000106 IT'S POSSIBLE ERNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE   ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION   HE HAD THAT TONSILLECTOMY IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE  
POD1000000018_S0000107 IN NINETEEN FORTY   HE HAD HIS BIGGEST HIT   WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU   THIS SONG IS STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH THE NAME ERNEST TUBB  
POD1000000018_S0000108 IF SOMEONE ONLY KNOWS ONE ERNEST TUBB SONG   IT'S USUALLY THIS SONG  
POD1000000018_S0000109 WE LIKE INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS BECOME A LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME  
POD1000000018_S0000110 E T WAS FINALLY BIG TIME  
POD1000000018_S0000111 THE TEXAS TROUBADOUR   ERNEST TUBB  
POD1000000018_S0000114 HE JOINED THE GRAND OLE OPRY IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE AND FORMED THE FIRST INCARNATION OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS  
POD1000000018_S0000115 TUBB WOULD STAY WORKING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE   SO MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS WOULD BE REPLACED EVERY NOW AND THEN  
POD1000000018_S0000116 BUDDY EMMONS   JACK GREENE   BILLY BYRD   LEON RHODES AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOINED THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER  
POD1000000018_S0000118 THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY ERNEST FOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND CARRIE RODGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM  
POD1000000018_S0000119 YOUR DAD MADE ALL THOSE GUYS HOUSEHOLD NAME  
POD1000000018_S0000120 YES HE DID  
POD1000000018_S0000121 JUST INTUBB  
POD1000000018_S0000122 HE WAS THE FIRST ONE AH TO CALL NAMES OUT ON RECORDS AND HE LOVED DOING THAT   HE LOVED THE GUYS   AND THEY WERE A BIG PART OF HIS SHOW I MEAN AH AND HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE CREDIT FOR IT  
POD1000000018_S0000123 AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY GET TOOK A COURSE   BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM   YOU DID YOU KNOW   HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL   AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREENE   AND CAL SMITH AND  
POD1000000018_S0000124 AH AND BECAUSE HE HAD THE WILBURNS WITH HIM FOR A WHILE   AND SKEETER WORKED SOME DATES WITH HIM   GEORGE JONES   STONEWALL JACKSON AND HE WAS ALWAYS PUSHING THEM   AND HE   LIKE ROY   I THINK   UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BIGGER THEY BECAME THE BIGGER HE BECAME  
POD1000000018_S0000125 GEORGE JONES AND STONEWALL JACKSON WERE NEVER TEXAS TROUBADOURS   JUSTIN MEANT E T TOOK THOSE GUYS OUT ON TOUR WITH HIM AS OPENING ACTS TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR OWN FOLLOWING   AND   OFTEN   HE DID A LOT MORE THAN THAT  
POD1000000018_S0000126 YEAH   AH I I DON'T HAVE MANY   BUT BUT I HAVE ONE ERNEST  
POD1000000018_S0000127 JOHNNY PAID CHECK  
POD1000000018_S0000129 AH ERNEST   ONE TIME   I WAS HANGING AROUND THE STREETS AND IT WAS SNOWING   AND BUDDY EMMONS TOOK ME ON TO MEET HIM   HE ALWAYS WANTS ME TO MEET HIM  
POD1000000018_S0000130 AND I HAD MET HIM BUT   I MEAN   I WANTED TO SIT AND TALK WITH HIM   MAYBE GET READY TO GO ON TOUR AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO STAY   YOU KNOW   I WAS AT THAT STAGE IN MY LIFE  
POD1000000018_S0000131 AND   EVIDENTLY   BUDDY HAD TOLD HIM THAT  
POD1000000018_S0000132 THE CARVER SAID WE GOT ON AND HE SAID I TALKED FOR A WHILE AND I WAS   YOU KNOW   AND HE SAID   WELL   IT'S ABOUT TIME TO LEAVE   HE SAID   YEAH  
POD1000000018_S0000133 HE SAID YOU WORKING AS WE FOLLOWS TO WORK AND I SAID   NO   HE SAID   YOU ARE NOW   HE WAS GOING ON   LIKE TEN DAYS OUT IN TEXAS AND IT WAS SNOWING HERE IN NASHVILLE AND I HAD NOWHERE TO   YOU KNOW   I JUST I WAS IN MY IN IN THAT PLACE   WHERE I ALWAYS   YOU KNOW  
POD1000000018_S0000134 HE TOOK ME ON THE ROAD   WOUND UP GIVING ME A SUIT   I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR SO HE GAVE ME ONE OF HIS OLD SUITS AND TOOK IT TO THE CLEANERS AND I HAD IT CUT DOWN THE FIRST DATE WE GOT IN TEXAS  
POD1000000018_S0000135 AND IT WAS SO   AH THERE WAS TWO POCKETS IN THE BACK   THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO TAKE UP   BUT I IT WAS A   AND AND I STILL GOT A PICTURE OF ME IN IN IN IN THAT SUIT  
POD1000000018_S0000136 AND I I HE LET ME GO OUT AND I OPENED HIS SHOW FOR HIM FOR TEN DAYS AND HE FED ME AND AT THE END OF THE TOUR GAVE ME SOME MONEY   SO THAT'S THE KINDA GUY HE WAS  
POD1000000018_S0000138 YOU CAN'T TELL THE HANK SNOW STORY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT ERNEST TUBB   E T TOLD JOHNNY CASH NOT TO SMILE WHEN HE PERFORMED FOLSOM PRISON BLUES   SO PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD REALLY FEEL THE SONG  
POD1000000018_S0000139 CASH NEVER FORGOT THE ADVICE   HANK WILLIAMS SENIOR WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ERNEST'S MUSIC AND ERNEST IS THE ONE WHO CONVINCED THE GRAND OLE OPRY TO BRING HANK BACK AFTER HIS FIRST FAILED AUDITION  
POD1000000018_S0000140 E T GOT HANK TO PROMISE HE WOULDN'T TOUCH ANY BOOZE FOR THREE MONTHS TO SWING THAT ONE  
POD1000000018_S0000141 IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN   ENOUGH RADIO LISTENERS WROTE LETTERS COMPLAINING OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND HIS MUSIC THAT HE LAUNCHED THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP IN NASHVILLE   IF YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE IN PERSON   THEY'D SHIP RECORDS DIRECTLY TO YOU  
POD1000000018_S0000142 IT WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS AND WOULD HELP KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE WHEN ROCK AND ROLL STEAMROLLED AMERICA IN THE FIFTIES  
POD1000000018_S0000144 THE RECORD SHOP OPERATED AT A LOSS OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT WAS OPEN BUT ERNEST KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HE KEPT IT ALIVE  
POD1000000018_S0000145 THE OPRY WAS A GREAT PROMOTIONAL TOOL FOR HIM AND HE'D STARTED HIS OWN SHOW ON W S M IN THE FOLLOWING TIME SLOT   WHEN THE OPRY WAS OVER   FANS COULD STAY TUNED IN FOR THE MIDNITE JAMBOREE  
POD1000000018_S0000147 ERNEST PLAYED HOST TO OPRY STARS AND NEWCOMERS ALIKE   MAKING SURE TO REMIND YOU THIS MUSIC WAS AVAILABLE FOR MAIL ORDER FROM ERNEST TUBB'S RECORD SHOP   HE TOOK THE CHANCE TO KEEP JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORY ALIVE   PITCHING HIS RECORDS AS WELL  
POD1000000018_S0000149 ERNEST NEVER GREW OUT OF HIS FASCINATION WITH JIMMIE RODGERS AND NEVER STOPPED REPAYING HIS DEBT TO JIMMIE'S WIDOW   CARRIE   JIMMIE'S DEATH HAD LEFT CARRIE IN A PRETTY BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION BUT SHE STILL GOT MONEY FROM THE SALES OF HIS RECORDS   WHICH WERE DECLINING  
POD1000000018_S0000150 HE REALIZED THE MORE JIMMIE RODGERS RECORDS SOLD   THE BETTER OFF CARRIE WOULD BE   SO E T PUSHED THOSE RECORDS AS HARD AS HE COULD  
POD1000000018_S0000151 CARRIE LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMIE'S   WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMIE RODGERS ON IT  
POD1000000018_S0000152 IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE   ERNEST HELPED FOUND THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL IN RODGERS HOMETOWN OF MERIDIAN   MISSISSIPPI   THAT'S A STAND UP GUY  
POD1000000018_S0000154 YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO'LL SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT JIM DENNY  
POD1000000018_S0000155 REMEMBER JIM   POOR KID FROM TENNESSEE   WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM THE MAILROOM TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT W S M AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY  
POD1000000018_S0000156 DIRECTOR OF ARTISTS SERVICES WAS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING HE BOOKED THE MUSICAL ACTS THAT PLAYED ON THE RADIO STATION AS WELL AS THE OPRY  
POD1000000018_S0000157 DENNY WAS A POWERFUL MAN IN NASHVILLE AND HE ACTED LIKE HE KNEW IT  
POD1000000018_S0000158 WHERE ERNEST TUBB BUILT A REPUTATION FOR HELPING YOUNG MUSICIANS   JIM DENNY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ACTING LIKE A DICK  
POD1000000018_S0000160 THE JOHNNY CASH E T GAVE ADVICE TO IS THE SAME JOHNNY CASH WHO HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE DENNY'S OFFICE  
POD1000000018_S0000162 JIM DENNY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK   HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESSMAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD  
POD1000000018_S0000163 DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ONTO THE OPRY AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE   BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE  
POD1000000018_S0000164 HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES  
POD1000000018_S0000165 HANK HAD MISSED A SCHEDULED OPRY APPEARANCE   MOST LIKELY FOR NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN THAT HE WAS DRUNK   DENNY SAID HE THOUGHT FIRING HANK WOULD MAKE HIM REALIZE HE NEEDED TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER  
POD1000000018_S0000166 THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED   HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY   IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION  
POD1000000018_S0000167 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THE YEAR HANK WILLIAMS DIED IS THE SAME YEAR THAT JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD PUBLISHING WITH WEBB PIERCE  
POD1000000018_S0000169 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A PUBLISHING COMPANY IS   IT USED TO BE THE HEART OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY   ON THE SURFACE   A PUBLISHING COMPANY'S PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE SURE SALES ROYALTIES WERE GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE  
POD1000000018_S0000170 THEY TOOK A BIG PERCENTAGE TO DO THIS SO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE A HIT OUT OF ONE OF THEIR WRITER'S SONGS THEY'D DO IT   AND IF THEY FORGOT TO SEND YOU YOUR WHOLE ROYALTY CHECK SOMETIMES   WELL   SHIT HAPPENS  
POD1000000018_S0000172 ROY ACUFF AND FRED ROSE HAD STARTED ACUFF ROSE MUSIC BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO  
POD1000000018_S0000173 SO MANY COUNTRY WRITERS WERE BEING SCREWED OVER BY PUBLISHING COMPANIES BASED OUT OF OTHER CITIES THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE ONE IN NASHVILLE   AN HONEST PUBLISHING COMPANY   RUN BY COUNTRY ARTISTS   FOR COUNTRY ARTISTS  
POD1000000018_S0000174 THEY WERE THE BEST GAME IN TOWN UNTIL JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD IN FIFTY THREE  
POD1000000018_S0000175 AS HEAD OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT W S M AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY   JIM DENNY CONTROLLED WHO GOT TO PLAY ON THE OPRY   THEIR PLACE IN THE LINEUP AND HOW LONG THEY GOT TO PLAY  
POD1000000018_S0000176 CAN YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS HEADED  
POD1000000018_S0000178 IF JIM DENNY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA   THEN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY  
POD1000000018_S0000180 ONCE HE'S GOT A WRITER SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD   THEN HE'S GETTING A HUGE PIECE OF ANY MONEY THEIR SONGS MAKE   IF THAT WRITER ALSO WANTS TO BE A PERFORMER   CONGRATULATIONS   YOU'RE ON THE OPRY TONIGHT  
POD1000000018_S0000181 IF THE WRITER DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PERFORMER   CONGRATULATIONS   WEBB PIERCE IS THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE OPRY AND HE'S PLAYING YOUR SONG ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT  
POD1000000018_S0000182 ROY ACUFF WAS PISSED OFF AND HE DIDN'T STAY QUIET ABOUT IT   HE SAID DENNY WAS GIVING THE BEST BOUNCE TO HIS OWN ARTIST   ARTISTS SIGNED TO ACUFF ROSE HAD A TENDENCY TO SEE ROY'S POINT  
POD1000000018_S0000183 ARTISTS SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD HAD A TENDENCY TO THINK JIM DENNY WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG   WEIRD   HUH  
POD1000000018_S0000184 LONG STORY SHORT   IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX   W S M FIRED JIM DENNY OVER HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  
POD1000000018_S0000186 HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTISTS   SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DENNY WAS FIRED   THEN DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY  
POD1000000018_S0000187 THEIR COMPETITION IN THE CIGARETTE BUSINESS   R J REYNOLDS   WAS A SPONSOR OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY  
POD1000000018_S0000188 SO   WHEN JIM DENNY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS   PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN  
POD1000000018_S0000189 HALF THE GRANDAL OPRY LINEUP THESE FANS LISTENED TO EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT WAS COMING TO STAGES ACROSS AMERICA FOR LIVE APPEARANCES  
POD1000000018_S0000190 WITH PHILIP MORRIS PAYING FOR EVERYTHING   THE ADMISSION WAS EVEN FREE  
POD1000000018_S0000191 IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED   UNTIL THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOKED A STOP IN MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE FIFTH ANNUAL JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL  
POD1000000018_S0000192 BUT IT WAS WORSE   THE PHILIP MORRIS SHOW WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE SECOND NIGHT OF THE TWO DAY JIMMIE RODGERS FESTIVAL  
POD1000000018_S0000194 FOR FIVE YEARS   ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMIE RODGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH   THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO   E T PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOL  
POD1000000018_S0000196 JIM DENNY WASN'T SIMPLY SETTING UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET WITH SOME HEALTHY COMPETITION  
POD1000000018_S0000197 HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMIE RODGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT  
POD1000000018_S0000198 IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE THAT AS A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER   CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF COACHELLA SET UP A FESTIVAL EIGHT MILES AWAY FROM BONNAROO   ON THE SAME WEEKEND   FOR FREE  
POD1000000018_S0000199 IT WOULD CRUSH BONNAROO   THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR  
POD1000000018_S0000200 THEY REGROUPED TO PUT ONE ON AGAIN IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE BUT CARRIE RODGERS HEALTH HAD ALREADY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE AND ERNEST TUBB WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE FESTIVAL AGAIN  
POD1000000018_S0000202 MOSTLY A KIND MAN   E T WAS DIFFERENT WHEN HE'D BEEN DRINKING   A BEER OR TWO WHILE GAMBLING WITH THE GUYS   HE'D BE FINE   BUT IT WAS THE TIMES WHEN HE'D GET DRINKING FOR A WHOLE DAY OR TWO   OR FIVE  
POD1000000018_S0000203 MIRRORS WOULD GET SMASHED   WINDOWS BROKEN   HE HAD A THING ABOUT GLASS   APPARENTLY  
POD1000000018_S0000205 ACCORDING TO BILLY BYRD   ERNEST TUBB'S REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK  
POD1000000018_S0000206 THEY CARTED HIM BACK TO NASHVILLE BUT HE WAS STILL DRINKING AND HE WAS STILL MAD AS HELL AT JIM DENNY  
POD1000000018_S0000207 FINALLY   HE CALLED DENNY AT HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO CUSS HIM OUT   DENNY SAID SOMETHING LIKE   WELL   IF YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT IT THEN HOW ABOUT YOU JUST MEET ME DOWN AT W S M RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL SETTLE THINGS FOR GOOD  
POD1000000018_S0000209 THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT PLAN TO ERNEST TUBB   HE STRAPPED ON A GUN BELT WITH BULLETS AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM IN THE HOLSTER AND DROVE DOWNTOWN IN HIS CADILLAC   WEARING HOUSE SLIPPERS  
POD1000000018_S0000210 MEANWHILE   WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE   HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO ERNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP  
POD1000000018_S0000212 SO   ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE W S M WAS LOCATED  
POD1000000018_S0000213 IT'S CLOSE TO FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING   PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SHOW UP FOR WORK  
POD1000000018_S0000215 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT   THE GUN GETS FIRED IN ALL OF THEM  
POD1000000018_S0000217 BILL WILLIAMS   THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT W S M   SAYS HE WAS WALKING IN TO WORK WHEN A GUNSHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL  
POD1000000018_S0000218 HE TURNED AROUND   YOU KNOW   PRETTY SCARED AND SAW ERNEST TUBB STANDING THERE IN HIS HOUSE SLIPPERS WITH A REVOLVER  
POD1000000018_S0000220 WHEN HE ASKED ERNEST WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING   ERNEST SAID   MY GOD   I'VE SHOT THE WRONG MAN  
POD1000000018_S0000221 WHETHER OR NOT HE'D BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL ANYONE   WE WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN   IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY SHOT SOMEONE AND WAS ONLY UPSET THAT SOMEONE WASN'T JIM DENNY  
POD1000000018_S0000222 EITHER WAY   ERNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON   BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK DEWITT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED   JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME  
POD1000000018_S0000223 HE WOULD HAVE EXCEPT THE POLICE HAD BEEN CALLED AS SOON AS OTHER EMPLOYEES HEARD A GUNSHOT IN THE OFFICE BUILDING  
POD1000000018_S0000225 ERNEST TUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNK AND DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON  
POD1000000018_S0000226 IT WAS MANDATORY TO HOLD PUBLIC INTOXICATION ARRESTEES FOR THREE HOURS  
POD1000000018_S0000227 SO ERNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME  
POD1000000018_S0000229 SIXTY DOLLARS BOND GOT HIM OUT AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT  
POD1000000018_S0000231 JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS   THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT  
POD1000000018_S0000233 THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST'S CAREER WHATSOEVER   APPARENTLY IF ALL E T WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY THEN THAT WAS FINE  
POD1000000018_S0000235 HIS CAREER LASTED INTO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES   HE WAS STILL DOING OVER TWO HUNDRED DATES ON THE ROAD A YEAR AND HE ONLY QUIT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS FROM HIS EMPHYSEMA

POD1000000018_S0000252 OKAY   FIRST OF ALL   IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE ERNEST TUBB IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRY MUSIC  
POD1000000018_S0000253 ASIDE FROM INFLUENCING BASICALLY EVERYONE WHO MATTERS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IF NOT   IN FACT THE FIRST ARTIST TO BRING AN ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYER WITH HIM ON TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY STAGE  
POD1000000018_S0000254 IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT A HONKY TONK   AND IT HAPPENED AFTER ERNEST TUBB   IT WAS INFLUENCED BY ERNEST TUBB   BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY AND EPISODE   I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING  
POD1000000018_S0000255 IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CLYDE MOODY TRY TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION  
POD1000000018_S0000256 THE C M P A HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN  
POD1000000018_S0000257 AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD   HE DONE SO MUCH TO HELP  
POD1000000018_S0000258 THIS RUMOR IS STILL SPREAD AS FACT AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S TRUE  
POD1000000018_S0000259 CHARLIE LOUVIN EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK   BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME  
POD1000000018_S0000260 FIRST OF ALL   THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST TUBB'S ESTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP   WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME   HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN  
POD1000000018_S0000261 IT'S JUST THAT'S NOT REALISTIC  
POD1000000018_S0000262 I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY IS EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM  
POD1000000018_S0000263 I DON'T REMEMBER WHO IT WAS BUT SOMEONE ACTUALLY DID GET IN TO SEE HIM AND THEY POINT BLANK SAID THEY WISH THEY HAD NOT GONE TO SEE HIM  
POD1000000018_S0000264 THEY COULD TELL HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT AND THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT AND THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING THAT BE THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM   SO HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID THAT  
POD1000000018_S0000265 AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO   WILL TRY TO SEE EARNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU   BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY  
POD1000000018_S0000266 SO   YOU KNOW   I MEAN THE END I I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED   YOU KNOW   AND IT'S SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS   I THINK THAT HE DID  
POD1000000018_S0000268 I THINK HE DID A LOT FOR THE COUNTRY MUSIC AND I THINK HE WENT OUT OF WAY THAT HE WANTED TO GO AT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME   OKAY BACK TO ERNEST TUBB AND JIM DENNY

POD1000000022_S0000005 TURNS OUT   WE'RE ALL VICTIMS JUST BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN BECAUSE JUST THINK FOR A SECOND ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE THE WORLD WAS FOR US   WHEN WE WERE ALL BABIES   THINK OF WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING A BABY  
POD1000000022_S0000006 IMAGINE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY AND IF YOU MADE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE TELL ME YOU WOULDN'T BE PART OF SOME SORT OF ADVOCACY GROUP FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH IT   THINK ABOUT IT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE BORN   IMAGINE BEING ROUNDED UP AGAINST YOUR WILL AND BEING ROCKETED OFF TO SOME ALIEN PLANET YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT  
POD1000000022_S0000007 YOU FIND YOURSELF ONCE YOU GET ON THAT PLANET ABSORBED INTO SOME FOREIGN TRIBE   YOU DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE   YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANYTHING IS   YOU YOU THINK THE REMOTE CONTROL TO THEIR T V IS FOOD   YOU'RE COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS   AND WHO DO YOU HAVE AS TEACHERS   ON THIS JOURNEY  
POD1000000022_S0000008 WHAT JUST SOME RANDOM MAN AND WOMAN THAT HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE YOU   DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL FOR THIS STUFF   BEING A BABY BEING A BABY IS LIKE GOING TO THE WORLD'S WORST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TEACHERS   THEY JUST PULL SOME RANDOM PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND SAY AH TEACH THESE KIDS ABOUT ROCKET SCIENCE   GO  
POD1000000022_S0000009 EXCEPT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT   WE'RE NOT JUST LEARNING ABOUT ROCKET SCIENCE   WE'RE LEARNING EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO EXIST   HOW WE LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE   HOW WE LOOK AT THE WORLD   HOW WE LOOK AT OURSELVES WITHIN THAT WORLD   WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE STRUGGLE FOR US FORMER BABIES OUT HERE WAS REAL  
POD1000000022_S0000010 AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CHAOTIC WORLD AS A BABY JUST TRY TO FIGURE THINGS OUT   NO ONE'S REALLY BLAMING YOU FOR JUST SORT OF GOING ALONG WITH A LOT OF THE WAYS PEOPLE WERE DOING THINGS AROUND YOU  
POD1000000022_S0000011 THERE'S A LOT TO FIGURE OUT   AND A LOT OF THESE WAYS WE'VE LEARNED TO MAKE SENSE OF STUFF ARE TOTALLY ARBITRARY   A LOT OF THE WAYS WE THINK ABOUT STUFF HAVE JUST BEEN SORT OF   ALMOST BY ACCIDENT   PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION   PHILOSOPHERS REALIZED THIS  
POD1000000022_S0000012 AND AT THE TIME OF SARTRE   FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE HAD BEEN POINTING OUT   HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING  
POD1000000022_S0000013 THAT'S HOW ENTRENCHED RELIGION WAS IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE BACK THEN AND THAT EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO CHURCH   EVEN IF YOUR FAMILY'S FIFTEEN GENERATIONS REMOVED FROM EVER HAVING STEPPED FOOT IN A CHURCH   SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE SO FOUNDATIONAL   THAT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF CONFUSED BABY TRY TO FIGURE THINGS OUT  
POD1000000022_S0000014 JUST WENT ALONG WITH CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXISTENCE THAT HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN CHRISTIANITY   FOR EXAMPLE   AH THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN LIFE   RIGHT   LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'LL SAY  
POD1000000022_S0000015 OKAY   SO I NEED TO CHOOSE A CAREER PATH FOR MY LIFE   I NEED TO DECLARE A MAJOR   BIG DECISION WHAT DO I DO   WELL WHENEVER I CLOSE MY EYES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANT   I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT   I CAN'T MAKE THAT BIG OF A DECISION YEAH I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO A FEW THINGS  
POD1000000022_S0000016 BUT HOW CAN I EVER KNOW  
POD1000000022_S0000018 I CAN SPEND HOURS A DAY THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF   I HAVE FAITH IT'S GONNA COME TO ME SOME DAY   I HAVE FAITH THAT I'M GONNA WAKE UP ONE DAY SOMETHINGS GONNA HAPPEN TO ME   SOME LIFE EVENT IS GOING TO OCCUR  
POD1000000022_S0000020 I'M GONNA REALIZE MY CALLING IN LIFE IN THAT MOMENT   PEOPLE DO THIS SAME THING WITH RELATIONSHIPS   THEY'LL SAY I HAVE THIS VAGUE IDEA UP IN MY HEAD OF MY ONE AND ONLY SOMEONE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE   DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE BUT I'M CONFIDENT ONE DAY I'M GONNA MEET SOMEONE  
POD1000000022_S0000021 AND THERE'S GONNA BE THIS MOMENT WHEN I LOOK AT THEM AND I REALIZE THEY'RE THE PERSON I WANNA SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH   PEOPLE DO THIS WITH ANYTHING   THEY THEY'LL DO IT WITH MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE   ONE DAY I'M GONNA WATCH THE RIGHT PERSON SCREAMING AT ME TO BE A BETTER PERSON  
POD1000000022_S0000022 AND FROM THEN ON OUT IT'S GONNA BE EASY FOR ME TO GO TO THE GYM AND EAT PINE CONES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE   IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT LIFE CHOICES THAT SOME THINKERS BELIEVE IS A LONG LOST RELIC OF THE REVELATORY WAY WE USED TO THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000023 THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME EVENT SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS  
POD1000000022_S0000024 IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE JUST   YOU KNOW   FORWARD THEM TO THE POPE'S INBOX   THAT'S A REASONABLE THING TO EXPECT   IN THAT WORLDVIEW   WELL THIS ISN'T THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF THESE LONG LOST REMNANTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN OUR THINKING  
POD1000000022_S0000025 AND ANOTHER MAJOR ONE ANOTHER ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD STILL USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS IS THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND WHO THEY ARE   JUST LIKE IN CHRISTIANITY WHERE YES YOU HAVE A BODY BUT YOUR TRUE SELF IS A SOUL  
POD1000000022_S0000026 IT'S AN ETERNAL SPIRIT HIDDEN DEEP DOWN WITHIN THAT BODY THAT YOU HAVE AN INTIMATE ACCESS TO   JUST LIKE THAT   A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD THINK OF THEIR TRUE SELF OR THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU   AS A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN US THAT ONLY WE AND OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS HAVE ACCESS TO  
POD1000000022_S0000027 YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE SURE WHEN I'M OUT IN PUBLIC I DO KIND OF PUT ON A MASK TO OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIAL UTILITY   I MEAN I DON'T ACT LIKE MY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRUE SELF IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THRU  
POD1000000022_S0000028 YEAH I TELL PEOPLE THINGS THEY WANT TO HEAR   I PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE LOOK THE FACT IS IT'S JUST NOT USEFUL TOO  
POD1000000022_S0000029 NOT TO MENTION I DON'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MY TRUE SELF TO THE PERSON IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THRU   WHO AM I REALLY THOUGH   WELL THAT'S SOMETHING I RESERVE FOR MY FAMILY MY CLOSEST FRIENDS   IN FACT EVEN SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DEPTHS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE ME  
POD1000000022_S0000030 MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU   BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY   IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS  
POD1000000022_S0000031 IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO   SARTRE WOULD SAY IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF  
POD1000000022_S0000032 AND YOU HAVE THIS IDEA UP YOUR HEAD OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S ONLY ACCESSED BY YOU AND YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS   BUT DON'T IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DECEPTION GOING ON THERE   MAYBE YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF A STORY YOU WANT TO HEAR THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TELLING THE STARBUCKS BARISTA A STORY  
POD1000000022_S0000033 THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM   IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN DOSTOYEVSKY'S BOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT   THE IDEA THAT   YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES THAN WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE   TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS  
POD1000000022_S0000034 AH BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECOND ON THE FIRST ONE'S A LITTLE CARTOONISH   BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE TO PULL US OUT OF THIS CONDITIONED WAY WE OFTEN LOOK AT THE SELF AND IT GET'S US TO HONESTLY START ASKING THIS QUESTION WHERE IS THIS SELF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY LOCATED  
POD1000000022_S0000035 FIRST EXAMPLE   IMAGINE A GUY THAT THINKS HE'S NAPOLEON   YOU KNOW   HE SPENDS ALL DAY EVERY DAY DRESSING UP IN PARISIAN MILITARY GARB   HE BUILDS A BUNCKER OUT OF COUCH CUSHIONS IN HIS FRONT ROOM   AGONIZING TO HIMSELF HOW AM I GOING TO CONQUER MOSCOW  
POD1000000022_S0000036 THAT GUY   NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON   IF YOU SET HIM DOWN AND THEN ASKED HIM CANDIDLY   NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY   DEEP DOWN INSIDE   HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE   COMMANDER OF THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH  
POD1000000022_S0000037 HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE   FATHER TO A MURDERED SON   AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE   BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON   WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON   IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY   AS OUTSIDERS   WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS  
POD1000000022_S0000038 INTERESTING   HERE'S THE LESS CARTOONISH EXAMPLE AND TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS APPLIES TO YOU   IMAGINE A GUY SITTING ON THE COUCH WATCHING T V WITH HIS PALS   THEY TURN ON THE NEWS AND THERE'S A STORY ABOUT SOME MASS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED AT A WALMART SOMEWHERE  
POD1000000022_S0000039 HE HEARS THE STORY   GETS KIND OF ANGRY   TURNS TO HIS FRIENDS AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT   THAT GUY AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM   THEY BETTER HOPE THEY NEVER SHOWS UP AT MY WALMART   SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN WHEN I'M THERE   I'M NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ON THE NEWS CHOPPER CAMERA SCREAMING AND RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE  
POD1000000022_S0000040 I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION   I MAY I'M GONNA GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK   I'M GONNA DO THIS   BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM   THAT'S ME   I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD   NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS  
POD1000000022_S0000041 HE MAY BELIEVE THAT WHO HE IS DEEP DOWN BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT   BUT IF NEXT SATURDAY HE'S OUT SHOPPING WITH HIS FAMILY   SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN AND ALL HIS WIFE AND KIDS SEE IS A A POOF OF SMOKE AND HE'S RUNNING OUT THE BACK DOOR   WHO IS THAT GUY REALLY  
POD1000000022_S0000042 IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE REFERENCE THIS THING WE CALL OUR SELF   INTUITIVELY IT CAN FEEL LIKE WELL I AM MY SELF   I KNOW WHO I AM   SO NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHO I AM BUT ME  
POD1000000022_S0000043 IN FACT IF YOU JUST RECITED THAT STATEMENT IN MOST PUBLIC SETTINGS PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE   YEAH   YEAH   YOU TELL THEM   ONLY YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEEP DOWN INSIDE   BUT IS THAT A DELUSION   IS THAT JUST A NARRATIVE THAT WE TELL OURSELVES TO SIMPLIFY THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF  
POD1000000022_S0000044 SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF   IT'S NOT A SOUL   IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU   WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH ME MORE MOVING PARTS  
POD1000000022_S0000045 AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANNA UNDERSTAND SARTRE'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT TO SARTRE SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER   WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY  
POD1000000022_S0000046 AND OUR TRANSCENDENCE   IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING THAT'S ALIVE   RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE BOTH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE   PUT VERY SIMPLY OUR FACTICITY IS THE COLLECTION OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT  
POD1000000022_S0000047 AND TRANSCENDENCE IS OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE OR THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL   LET'S BREAK IT DOWN FURTHER THOUGH   REMEMBER LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT BEING IN ITSELF VERSUS BEING FOR ITSELF   BEING IN ITSELF AS BEING KIND OF LIKE MATTER   THIS INERT   FEATURELESS   BLOB OF EXISTENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000048 FULLY AFFIRMATIVE   AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION   WELL ONE DAY   WHEN SARTRE'S TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS   THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF  
POD1000000022_S0000049 QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS   AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT   WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM   AFTER LISTENING TO LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT   BUT THEN SARTRE POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY   MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000050 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF AS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT SARTRE COOKED UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER  
POD1000000022_S0000051 SARTRE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE   SEE BECAUSE   ON ONE HAND   ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF   IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US  
POD1000000022_S0000052 YOU ASK ME WHO I AM AND OFTENTIMES I WILL STATE THE FACTS ABOUT MYSELF   OH I AM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD   THAT'S A FACT   I AM A HORSE WRANGLER BY PROFESSION   THAT'S A FACT   I MAKE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR   I DRIVE A FORD FOCUS  
POD1000000022_S0000053 I I I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS   THINGS LIKE THAT   RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS   STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US   THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY   BUT WHAT SARTRE WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM  
POD1000000022_S0000054 THEY NEVER TELL US THE FULL STORY   AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND A HUMAN BEING   JUST BY DEFAULT IS TO UNDERSTAND A TYPE OF BEING THAT HAS POSSIBILITIES   NONE OF US ARE PURE FACTICITY   IN OTHER WORDS  
POD1000000022_S0000055 THE ONLY TIME A HUMAN BEING IS PURE FACTICITY IS WHEN THEY'RE DEAD   YES   WE HAVE A SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US RIGHT NOW   BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE INTO SOMETHING ELSE AND IF WE'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE SELF   IF WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE OF WHO SOMEONE IS  
POD1000000022_S0000056 THE CHOICES WE MAKE ABOUT WHICH OF THESE POSSIBILITIES WE'RE GONNA BRING ABOUT   END UP BEING JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE RIGHT NOW   FOR EXAMPLE   IF I'M GOING TO SCHOOL TO BECOME AN I T CONSULTANT OR IF I'M TRAINING FOR A MARATHON OR IF I'M LOSING A BUNCH OF WEIGHT FOR WEDDING PICTURES  
POD1000000022_S0000057 A BIG PART OF UNDERSTANDING WHO I AM IS UNDERSTANDING THE THING I'M ACTIVELY TRYING TO CHANGE INTO AN I T CONSULTANT   A MARATHON RUNNER   IN OTHER WORDS   PART OF UNDERSTANDING THE FULL PICTURE OF ME IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT I AM NOT YET  
POD1000000022_S0000058 YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD SARTRE DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE   JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT   IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM   I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET  
POD1000000022_S0000059 WHEN I CONSIDER MY TRANSCENDENCE   JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF   THESE TWO ASPECTS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING   FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE   ARE ENTANGLED   INTERTWINED AND IN SOME CASES RELIANT ON EACH OTHER FOR THEIR VERY EXISTENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000060 YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE ARE CONSTANTLY AFFECTING EACH OTHER AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE ARE OFTEN TIMES CAUSED BY WHAT POSSIBILITIES YOU DECIDE TO BRING ABOUT AND THE POSSIBILITIES YOU'VE DECIDED TO EXPLORE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LIMITED BY THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE  
POD1000000022_S0000061 LET'S STOP WITH THE HYPOTHETICALS AND GIVE A REAL EXAMPLE   ALRIGHT ME   I'LL USE ME AS AN EXAMPLE   I AM SIX FEET TALL A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO POUNDS THIS MORNING   NOW NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO  
POD1000000022_S0000062 I AM NEVER GOING TO BECOME A HORSE JOCKEY   IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME   AS LONG AS THERE'RE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE FOUR FOUR EIGHT EIGHTY FIVE POUNDS THE FACTICITY THAT I'M A CERTAIN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS MY ABILITY TO TRANSCEND AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS  
POD1000000022_S0000063 I'M NEVER WINNING THE KENTUCKY DERBY   IT'S NOT HAPPENING   THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR ABILITY TO TRANSCEND IS OFTEN TIMES LIMITED BY THE FACTS ABOUT US   ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS BORN WITH A PARTICULAR FACE AND A PARTICULAR ABILITY TO PUT ON MUSCLE  
POD1000000022_S0000064 NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO I AM NEVER GOING TO BE AN INSTAGRAM MODEL   THE THE FACTICITY OF MY FACE MY   AH   MY FACTICITY AND AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF GOING ON THERE  
POD1000000022_S0000065 LOOK   I WILL NEVER BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT PEOPLE WANNA VOLUNTARILY LOOK AT AND THEN CLICK AN EMOJI THAT SIGNIFIES HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT THE MOST RECENT PICTURE OF ME   IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND THESE FACTS ABOUT ME ARE THE PARAMETERS I LIVE MY LIFE AND EXERCISE MY FREEDOM WITHIN   SEE BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING   AND THIS GOES FOR ALL OF YOU OUT THERE  
POD1000000022_S0000066 WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT   IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS  
POD1000000022_S0000067 YOU KNOW WE OFTEN SAY THINGS LIKE   I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO   BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT   I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING YOU CAN'T WRAP YOURSELF IN A PROTECTIVE COCOON AND THEN EMERGE A UNICORN IN THREE DAYS   YOU CAN'T FLY TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AND LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE  
POD1000000022_S0000068 NO   FREEDOM IS ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND IT'S THOSE LIMITATIONS THAT GIVE A LOT OF WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO IN LIFE IT'S VALUE   WE SEE THIS IN ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS OF ART YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WRITES A REALLY GOOD HAIKU  
POD1000000022_S0000069 WE SEE IT AS GOOD NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE GREATEST WORDS THAT COULD EVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLY STRUNG TOGETHER   NOW THE BEAUTY OF THE HAIKU IS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GIVEN AN ARTIST TOTAL FREEDOM WITHIN A SET OF LIMITATIONS THAT WE IMPOSE  
POD1000000022_S0000070 FIVE SYLLABLES   SEVEN SYLLABLES   FIVE SYLLABLES   GO   IN OTHER WORDS   THE LIMITATIONS ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES THE HAIKU BEAUTIFUL   AND THIS APPLIES TO LIFE AS WELL  
POD1000000022_S0000071 THE FACTICITY THAT YOU WERE BORN INTO   YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL LIMITATIONS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO AFFECT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE   SO TRY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE IT'S A PIECE OF ART YOU'RE CREATING UM  
POD1000000022_S0000072 BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCEIS   IT'S NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR SELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT   BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC  
POD1000000022_S0000073 UNCHANGING THING THAT YOU CAN POINT TO   THE POINT THAT IS MAKING IS THAT WHO YOU ARE IS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CHANGE   SOMETIMES SMALL CHANGES   SOMETIMES BIGGER CHANGES   BUT CHANGING AND IN FLUX   BUT DON'T GO EXTREME IN THE OTHER DIRECTION  
POD1000000022_S0000074 DON'T START THINKING OF YOUR SELF AS THIS ETHEREAL THING THAT CAN NEVER BE DEFINED   AGAIN   ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE WHEN YOU'RE FINALLY TURNED INTO TOTAL FACTICITY   YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE CERTAIN FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND CERTAIN POSSIBILITIES AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO BRING ABOUT  
POD1000000022_S0000075 UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING   NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE'S WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK   NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE   RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE   NO  
POD1000000022_S0000076 NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME SARTRE THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES ARE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT   IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF  
POD1000000022_S0000077 SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET   COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT   IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE   OR AS SARTRE SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD  
POD1000000022_S0000078 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT   THINK ABOUT THE WAY FOLLOWERS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS HAVE TRADITIONALLY LOOKED AT GOD   WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE GOD   WELL GOD IS PERFECT   GOD IS IN THIS MOMENT EVERYTHING HE WILL EVER BE   IF GOD HAD A JOB INTERVIEW AND THE PERSON ASKED HIM   WHAT'S ONE THING YOU'D CHANGE ABOUT YOURSELF  
POD1000000022_S0000079 GOD LITERALLY DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION   BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL WITH THE SNAP OF HIS FINGERS   HE CAN DO ANYTHING   HE WANTS TO DO   IN OTHER WORDS   IN THIS OLD STYLE   TRADITIONAL VIEW OF WHAT GOD IS ON ONE HAND  
POD1000000022_S0000080 GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY   BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE   SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000081 AND IT'S ALSO NO COINCIDENCE THAT AS PEOPLE NAVIGATE THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF TACTICS THEY USE TO TURN THEMSELVES EITHER INTO SOMEBODY THAT IGNORES THEIR POSSIBILITIES AND ARE PERFECT AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW OR SOMEONE WHO IGNORES THE VERY REAL UNFORTUNATE FACTS ABOUT THEMSELVES  
POD1000000022_S0000082 AND THEY STAY LOST IN THESE UNATTAINABLE DREAMS THEIR ENTIRE LIFE   THIS IS THE CONTEXT WE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND A CONCEPT WE TALKED ABOUT WELL OVER A YEAR AGO ON THE ONE EPISODE WE DID ON SARTRE   THE PRIMARY TACTIC THAT PEOPLE USE IN THEIR LIVES TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY  
POD1000000022_S0000083 OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH   LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT   BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE   I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF  
POD1000000022_S0000084 SARTRE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB   THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES   RIGHT   DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT   GOOD POSTURE   VERY PROPER  
POD1000000022_S0000085 HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY   HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC   PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES   SARTRE CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT   THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT  
POD1000000022_S0000086 HE SEEMS TO HAVE RELEGATED HIMSELF TO JUST   PLAYING THE PART OF A WAITER   HE'S GOING TO THE MOTIONS TRYING TO TURN HIMSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY   JUST A WAITER AND NOTHING ELSE   NOW EVEN THOUGH WAITERS DON'T ACT LIKE THIS OFTEN IN TODAY'S WORLD  
POD1000000022_S0000087 GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTRE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE   I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON   IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER   THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF  
POD1000000022_S0000088 HI   I'M JOHN I'M GONNA BE TAKING CARE YOU TODAY   CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP   OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING   BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL   HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTING FOR YOU GUYS   YOU ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT   THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH   I'M GONNA LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE  
POD1000000022_S0000090 ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM   IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS   NO   HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER   NOW THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE   IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS  
POD1000000022_S0000091 SARTRE THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE   WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME   I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM   THAT'S MY IDENTITY  
POD1000000022_S0000092 I AM A LIBERTARIAN   I AM A MORMON AND THAT'S THAT   WHAT WE'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO DO WITH THESE PROCLAMATIONS IS GIVE OURSELVES AN ESSENCE IN A WORLD WHERE EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000093 ALL THESE THINGS ARE JUST US WANTING TO THINK ABOUT OUR SELVES AS SOME STATIC THINGS SET IN STONE AND RUN FROM THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE   NOW WHEN WE TAKE AN HONEST LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES AT OUR DISPOSAL   IT TERRIFIES US AND PRODUCES A FEELING CALLED NAUSEA  
POD1000000022_S0000094 AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA   WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES   NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRE'S BEING AND NOTHINGNESS   YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH  
POD1000000022_S0000095 IS AN INESCAPABLE CONDITION OF BEING A HUMAN BEING AND THAT EVEN WHEN WE'RE SELF AWARE OF THE BAD FAITH WE'RE ENGAGING IN   WE'RE STILL ENGAGING IN BAD FAITH   IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS THE MAIN TEXT OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS   YOU MIGHT GET THAT IMPRESSION AND IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY SAD PICTURE  
POD1000000022_S0000096 BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS   SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN THIS LIFE   WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS   UM AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER  
POD1000000022_S0000097 AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY   NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ONCE SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR SO WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT   UM BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH   LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I  
POD1000000022_S0000098 REALLY   HERE'S THE THING   WHEN IT COMES TO THESE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT   WHEN YOU JUST THINK GENERALLY ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE   WHERE ARE THOSE THINGS LOCATED   WHERE ARE YOU LOOKING TO FIND THOSE  
POD1000000022_S0000099 THOSE THINGS AREN'T HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO   YOU MAY HAVE A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE OF THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE   BUT NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH AND TELL YOURSELF A STORY ABOUT THEM  
POD1000000022_S0000100 SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED V I P ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE   I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY   ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000101 IN FACT   JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE   BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE   THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL   TO SARTRE  
POD1000000022_S0000102 JUST LIKE YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR SELVES IS OUTSIDE OF US   IT'S AN ABSTRACTION   IT'S THE CONGLOMERATION OF ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER ACTUALLY DONE IN YOUR LIFE  
POD1000000022_S0000103 WHEN YOU WANT TO GET A SOLID ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I   YOU DON'T REFERENCE THE STORY THAT YOU TELL YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD THAT'S CLOUDED BY ALL SORTS OF BAD FAITH AND WISHFUL THINKING LIKE THE GUY THAT THINKS HE WOULD TRY TO TAKE DOWN THE GUNMAN AT WALMART  
POD1000000022_S0000104 NO   WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES   THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE   IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO   IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE   AND SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF  
POD1000000022_S0000105 AS THOUGH IT'S THE THING INSIDE OF YOU AND YOU START LOOKING AT IT MORE ACCURATELY AS THIS ABSTRACTION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF US WHAT YOU INEVITABLY START TO REALIZE IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE   WITHOUT REFERENCING THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE VIEW YOU  
POD1000000022_S0000106 MORE THAN THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF BEING WITHOUT REFERENCING OTHER PEOPLE AND MEAN HERE'S WHAT HE'S GETTING AT   SO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING BEING WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF BUT IT'S RIGHT HERE   FAIRLY LATE IN BEING  
POD1000000022_S0000107 AND NOTHINGNESS THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS   LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS   SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT  
POD1000000022_S0000108 THIS IS SARTRE'S CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS   NOW HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I   WELL AGAIN   THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US   IT'S AN ABSTRACTION  
POD1000000022_S0000109 AND WHAT SARTRE POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE   FOR EXAMPLE   WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT   WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE   RIGHT  
POD1000000022_S0000110 WHETHER I'M A NICE OR MEAN PERSON   LOOK   I MAY THINK OF MYSELF AS A NICE PERSON   BUT IF EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON I ENCOUNTER ALL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE SAYS THAT I'M MEAN   FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I'M A MEAN PERSON   THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF  
POD1000000022_S0000111 AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE   BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US AN WHAT HE SUBSCRIBES IS A A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US  
POD1000000022_S0000112 WE'RE ALMOST ALWAYS BEING TURNED INTO PURE FACTICITY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S MINDS   FOR EXAMPLE   HAVE YOU EVER WALK AROUND IN YOURSELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK   MAYBE YOU JUST GOT A NEW PAIR OF SHOES AND YOU THINK THEY LOOK WEIRD AND AS YOU'RE WALKING AROUND YOU FEEL LIKE EVERY PERSON THAT PASSES YOU IS LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE THINKING  
POD1000000022_S0000113 WOW   WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY PICKED OUT THOSE SHOES   THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PERSON THAT DOESN'T CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK   IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE TURNING YOU INTO AN OBJECT IN THEIR SUBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD PURE FACTICITY  
POD1000000022_S0000114 YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND   THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON   BUT SARTRE'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD   THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID   EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING  
POD1000000022_S0000115 PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME   THE POINT THAT SARTRE WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC   THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU   PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS   THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME  
POD1000000022_S0000116 SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT WE EXIST ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT WHILE THE INSIGHTS OTHER PEOPLE GIVE US ABOUT WHO WE ARE ARE NO DOUBT VALUABLE   WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DYNAMIC OF BEING FOR OTHERS   WHAT I MEAN IS  
POD1000000022_S0000117 JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY SEES YOU WEARING WEIRD SHOES ONE DAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOW WEIRD SHOES GUY IN PERPETUITY   IN OTHER WORDS   DON'T SLIP INTO BAD FAITH WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU   NO MATTER HOW CONVENIENT IT MAY BE TO PRESCRIBE YOURSELF IN ESSENCE AND DENY YOUR TRANSCENDENCE  
POD1000000022_S0000118 DON'T TURN YOURSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY AND JUST ACCEPT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU YOU ARE   MAYBE YOU ARE WEIRD SHOES GUY RIGHT NOW   BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE FUTURE   BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS DON'T DENY YOUR FACTICITY   DON'T TELL YOURSELF YOUR SHOES ARE FINE  
POD1000000022_S0000119 DON'T TELL YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS AND THAT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU AT ALL   OBVIOUSLY IT DOES   THAT'S SLIPPING INTO ANOTHER KIND OF BAD FAITH  
POD1000000022_S0000120 SO TO SUM THIS UP   I GUESS   LOOK INTUITIVELY  
POD1000000022_S0000121 IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WE TRUST EARLY   BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS CAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF  
POD1000000022_S0000123 PERSPECTIVE   AND THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR FRIENDS REINFORCE THIS PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE  
POD1000000022_S0000124 IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE   IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE FOR OURSELVES   THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS   TO SARTRE  
POD1000000022_S0000125 FOR EXAMPLE   IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF IN YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON   SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME  
POD1000000022_S0000126 OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER   MAKING YOU FEEL SMART   OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM   TO SARTRE   WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES  
POD1000000022_S0000127 OF COURSE WE GIVE THEM PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO OUR BIASED NARRATIVE OF OURSELVES  
POD1000000022_S0000128 AND OF COURSE IT'S GONNA FEEL VALIDATING   OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN   SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES   THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU  
POD1000000022_S0000129 IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO   THANK YOU FOR LISTENING   I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME

POD1000000027_S0000009 FROM E S P N YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIRTY FOR THIRTY PODCAST   MY NAME IS JODY AVERGAN WELCOME TO OUR FIFTH SEASON OF ORIGINAL AUDIO DOCUMENTARIES   AS WE'VE DONE BEFORE   WE'RE DEVOTING THE ENTIRE SEASON TO ONE STORY IS TOTAL OVER FIVE PARTS  
POD1000000027_S0000011 IT'S ABOUT A SCANDAL   THAT ROCKED N B A AND TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW POWER RACE AND CELEBRITY INTERSECT IN MODERN SPORTS  
POD1000000027_S0000013 FOR THIS SEASON WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH E S P N RAMONA SHELBURNE   ONE OF OUR TOP N B A REPORTERS AND L A NEEDED AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE STORY FROM THE MOMENT IT BROKE  
POD1000000027_S0000014 RAMONA IS YOUR HOST FOR ALL FIVE EPISODES   THE QUICK ORDER OF WARNING THIS SEASON CONTAINS MATURE SUBJECT MATTER AND LANGUAGE AND NOW COMING UP BACK THE BREAK FROM THIRTY FOR THIRTY AND UNDEFEATED THE STIRRING UP FEARS  
POD1000000027_S0000016 SHELLY STERLING THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GONNA RETURN SOME CLOTHES TO NEIMAN MARCUS WHEN SHE GOT IN HER MERCEDES BENZ STATION WAGON AND MADE THE DRIVE FROM MALIBU TO BEVERLY HILLS   IT WAS EARLY IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSANDS AND FOURTEEN  
POD1000000027_S0000017 AND EVEN THOUGH SHELLY WAS ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS OLD   SHE WAS STILL GOING INTO TOWN AS RICH PEOPLE CALL BEVERLY HILLS   FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK   IT'S HARD TO GUESS SHELLY'S AGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT  
POD1000000027_S0000018 BECAUSE SHE KEEPS HER HAIR A CONVINCING PALE BLONDE   AND HER FACE IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED   DRIVING INTO BEVERLY HILLS IS BASICALLY LIKE ENTERING A STATE PARK FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000019 THERE ARE THE ICONIC BROWN AND YELLOW SIGNS THAT LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENTERED A SPECIAL PLACE   AND SHELLY STERLING AND HER HUSBAND DONALD OWNED A TON OF IT  
POD1000000027_S0000020 OVER THEIR SIXTY YEAR MARRIAGE   THE STERLINGS BUILT A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE IN THEIR HEYDAY   THEY WERE THE LARGEST RESIDENTIAL LANDLORDS IN L A COUNTY  
POD1000000027_S0000022 BUT MOST PEOPLE KNEW HER HUSBAND DONALD STERLING AS THE LONG TIME OWNER OF THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS   ONE OF THE WORST OWNERS IN ALL OF SPORTS   HIS TEAM WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE N B A FOR DECADES  
POD1000000027_S0000023 FOR SHELLY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A JAUNT DOWN RODEO DRIVE TO RETURN SOME WILDLY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES   BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HER HER HUSBAND WAS ALSO AT NEIMAN MARCUS THAT DAY  
POD1000000027_S0000024 WITH A WOMAN FORTY NINE YEARS HIS JUNIOR NAMED V STIVIANO   SHE WASN'T THE FIRST MISTRESS   NOT EVEN CLOSE   BUT V WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT  
POD1000000027_S0000026 SHELLY TOLD ME THAT STORY WHEN WE MET IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AT THE BEVERLY HILLS PLAZA HOTEL OR MY HOTEL AS SHE CALLS IT  
POD1000000027_S0000027 SHELLY WAS EIGHTY FOUR AT THE TIME BUT SHE CAN TELL THAT STORY OF THAT RUN IN WITH DONALD AND V FIVE YEARS EARLIER WITH EXACTING DETAIL  
POD1000000027_S0000028 I HAPPENED TO BE THERE TO RETURN SOMETHING AND SHE WAS THERE WITH DONALD AND WITH SOME OTHER FRIENDS   AND WE HAD A BIG CONFRONTATION   SHE WAS VERY VERY VERY NASTY AND MEAN TO ME  
POD1000000027_S0000029 WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SHE RAN INTO SHELLY   I THINK AT NORDSTROM   AND THEY STARTED TALKING AND I GUESS THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND  
POD1000000027_S0000030 THAT'S V STIVIANO'S LAWYER MAC NEHORAY   AND WHEN I TOLD SHELLY STERLING HIS VERSION OF THE STORY   SHE SCOFFED  
POD1000000027_S0000031 IT WAS AT NEIMAN MARCUS  
POD1000000027_S0000032 AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY THAT SHELLY TOOK THE TIME TO CORRECT HIM   I MEAN   HERE IS A WOMAN TALKING TO A FEMALE REPORTER ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITY   WHO CARES WHETHER YOU CONFRONT YOUR HUSBAND'S MISTRESS OUTSIDE OF NEIMAN MARCUS OR NORDYS  
POD1000000027_S0000033 BUT THE DETAILS MATTER HERE   IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT   BECAUSE THAT MEETING OUTSIDE NEIMAN MARCUS THAT PETTY SQUABBLE BETWEEN A WIFE AND HER HUSBAND'S MISTRESS SET OFF A CHAIN OF EVENTS  
POD1000000027_S0000034 THAT IN THE END   LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS   A CONTROVERSY THAT FORCED THE N B A TO FINALLY DEAL WITH DONALD STERLING AFTER DECADES OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR   AND HAD RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LEAGUE  
POD1000000027_S0000036 THIS IS THE STERLING AFFAIRS   FROM THIRTY FOR THIRTY PODCASTS AND THE UNDEFEATED   I'M RAMONA SHELBURNE  
POD1000000027_S0000039 I'VE COVERED BASKETBALL IN L A FOR A LONG TIME   THE N B A IS A LEAGUE OF HUGE PERSONALITIES AND EVEN BIGGER EGOS FIGHTING FOR POWER AND IF YOU WANT THE REAL SCORE   THAT'S THE GAME YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW  
POD1000000027_S0000041 I LEARNED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT THERE'S NO OTHER OWNER IN BASKETBALL WITH QUITE THE SAME PERSONALITY   OR EGO   OF DONALD STERLING   STERLING WASN'T A BASKETBALL GUY   HE WAS A PERSONAL INJURY LAWYER   AND THEN HE GOT FILTHY RICH OFF OF REAL ESTATE  
POD1000000027_S0000043 THAT'S WHAT HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT  
POD1000000027_S0000045 I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY HE EVEN KEPT THE CLIPPERS   WHEN HIS REPUTATION AS AN OWNER WAS SO BAD   BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT DEEP DOWN HE WANTED WHAT EVERYONE IN THE GAME IS SUPPOSED TO WANT TO WIN  
POD1000000027_S0000047 BUT RICH PEOPLE   LIKE DONALD STERLING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR RICH PEOPLE   DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD AS THE REST OF US   DON'T PLAY BY THE SAME RULES   WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY   IT'S LIKE YOU'RE RUBBER   EVERYTHING JUST BOUNCES OFF OF YOU  
POD1000000027_S0000048 EVEN THREE DECADES OF DRIVING AN N B A FRANCHISE INTO THE GROUND   WHEN YOU'RE AS RICH AS DONALD AND SHELLY   YOU GET TO TELL YOURSELF THAT EVERYTHING IS FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000049 I FEEL FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000050 FEEL FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000051 FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000052 HE WAS JUST SO FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000053 I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN L A AND I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE USE THE WORD FABULOUS AS MUCH AS THESE TWO DO  
POD1000000027_S0000054 THEY WERE FABULOUS   IT WAS JUST FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000055 EVEN THEIR COURT BATTLES  
POD1000000027_S0000056 I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO HAS HELPED ME   MY ATTORNEYS THEY WERE FABULOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000057 AND OF COURSE ANYTHING RELATED TO THEIR TEAM  
POD1000000027_S0000058 AND THE U S TEAM THAT WON AT ALL THE FABULOUS AMERICAN TEAM   WE ARE FABULOUS   LET'S GIVE A HAND TO AMERICA U S A  
POD1000000027_S0000060 AND DONALD STERLING'S LIFE WAS FABULOUS   WHY WOULD HE THINK OTHERWISE   NOBODY EVER QUESTIONED HIM TO HIS FACE   ANYWAY   HE DID WHATEVER HE WANTED   HE SAID WHATEVER HE WANTED   HE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHOMEVER HE WANTED  
POD1000000027_S0000062 I DIDN'T KNOW V STIVIANO BACK THEN   AND   YES   THAT'S HER REAL NAME V   JUST THE LETTER V WITH A PERIOD   SHE WAS BORN MARIA VANESSA PEREZ  
POD1000000027_S0000063 BUT CHANGED HER NAME TO V STIVIANO   AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME SHE'D MET DONALD AT A SUPER BOWL PARTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN   BEFORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO CLIMB OUT OF THE POVERTY THAT SHE'D GROWN UP IN  
POD1000000027_S0000064 SHE'D BEEN RUNNING A FOOD TRUCK BUSINESS AND TRYING TO WORK HER WAY ONTO REALITY T V SHOWS AND COZYING UP TO WHOMEVER WAS THE MOST RELEVANT   POWERFUL OR FAMOUS   THEN SHE MET DONALD  
POD1000000027_S0000066 THERE'S AN UNWRITTEN CONTRACT BETWEEN YOUNG WOMEN AND THEIR VERY RICH BUT MUCH OLDER SUGAR DADDIES THAT HELPS EACH SIDE PRETEND IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND NOT SEX FOR MONEY   NEVER TALK ABOUT AGE   PRETEND LOOKS DON'T MATTER  
POD1000000027_S0000067 MONEY AND HERMES BAGS ARE GIFTS   AND NEVER   EVER HUMILIATE THE WIFE   BUT V STIVIANO EITHER DIDN'T KNOW OR DIDN'T CARE   BECAUSE SHE BROKE EVERY LAST RULE IN THE MISTRESS TERMS AND AGREEMENTS  
POD1000000027_S0000068 SHE WENT RIGHT AT SHELLY  
POD1000000027_S0000069 SHE SAID TO THE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE   I'M GONNA OWN THE OFFICE ONE DAY   AND SHE SAID TO THE CLIPPER PEOPLE   SHE SAYS   THIS IS GONNA BE MY TEAM ONE DAY   I MEAN JUST BOLD   REALLY BOLD  
POD1000000027_S0000070 AND   IT ALL GOT BACK TO ME   YOU KNOW  
POD1000000027_S0000071 SHE KEPT TELLING PEOPLE SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT MRS   STERLING  
POD1000000027_S0000072 KATHRINE BAUMANN IS ONE OF SHELLY'S BEST FRIENDS AND A LONGTIME CLIPPERS FAN  
POD1000000027_S0000073 SHE WOULD STALK SHELLY SHE WOULD WATCH WHERE SHELLY WOULD GO   AND THEN SHE'D SHOW UP   AND I DO REMEMBER THE ONE TIME SHE WENT INTO THE RESTROOM WHERE SHELLY WAS   JUST PARADED AROUND   SHOWED OFF HERSELF   THEN SHELLY WALKED OUT  
POD1000000027_S0000074 AT CLIPPERS GAMES   THE ENTIRE EXTENDED STERLING UNIVERSE WAS USUALLY THERE AND USUALLY JUST FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER   SOMETIMES   SHELLY AND DONALD SAT IN THEIR COURTSIDE SEATS TOGETHER   AND V SAT IN HER SEATS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE COURT  
POD1000000027_S0000075 OTHER NIGHTS   V WOULD SIT NEXT TO DONALD   AND SHELLY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN   CLIPPERS PLAYERS LIKE RYAN HOLLINS AND MATT BARNES GOT USED TO V BEING AROUND   YOU COULDN'T NOT NOTICE HER  
POD1000000027_S0000076 SHE WOULD JUST PARADE AROUND THE ARENA AND IT LIKE IT WAS SO AWKWARD LIKE WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT YOU'RE DOING IT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES AS IF WE WERE SILLY   AND SO IT WAS AN ODD   ODD SITUATION  
POD1000000027_S0000077 NOBODY LIKED HER   WE KNEW WHY SHE WAS HERE AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY TO BEGIN WITH BUT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T OUR PLACE TO SPEAK ON IT AT THE TIME  
POD1000000027_S0000078 CLIPPERS EMPLOYEES OFTEN GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BIZARRE TRIANGLE   SHELLY WOULD CALL TEAM PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER DEMANDING THAT V NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING   AND THEN DONALD WOULD CALL ROESER AND ASK HIM TO LEAVE FOUR TICKETS FOR HER  
POD1000000027_S0000079 THESE WERE RELATIONSHIPS BEGGING TO IMPLODE   BUT NONE OF THE ENTANGLED EVER TRIED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM   DONALD   SHELLY   V EACH KEPT PUSHING EACH OTHER   WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BREAK  
POD1000000027_S0000080 WELL   THE BREAKING STARTED ON CHRISTMAS DAY   TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE   V CALLED THE STERLING HOUSE ASKING TO SPEAK TO DONALD  
POD1000000027_S0000081 WE WERE ALL SITTING DOWN CHRISTMAS DAY HAVING DINNER   AND SHE CALLED  
POD1000000027_S0000082 SHELLY WAS MORTIFIED   THE FAMILY WAS SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE WAITING FOR DONALD AS HE'S PACING ON THE TENNIS COURTS OUTSIDE   FIGHTING WITH HIS MISTRESS  
POD1000000027_S0000083 I DON'T KNOW   THEY HAD SOME ARGUMENT   AND UM   THE FAMILY HEARD ABOUT IT YOU KNOW AND IT JUST   IT WASN'T A GOOD SCENE  
POD1000000027_S0000085 THE FIGHT WITH SHELLY STARTED WHEN HE HUNG UP  
POD1000000027_S0000086 NOT THAT THAT WAS UNCOMMON   EVEN WITHOUT V   THEY FOUGHT OFTEN   BUT THIS WAS ESCALATING   SHELLY AND DONALD'S YOUNGEST SON   SCOTT HAD TO STEP IN BEFORE IT GOT PHYSICAL   HE CONFRONTED HIS FATHER AND DEMANDED HE STOP THIS NONSENSE WITH V  
POD1000000027_S0000087 AND STOPPED DISRESPECTING HIS MOTHER LIKE THIS  
POD1000000027_S0000089 IT WAS A BIG MOMENT   BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT  
POD1000000027_S0000091 A WEEK LATER   SCOTT DIED  
POD1000000027_S0000093 IT WAS FIRST REPORTED TO BE A PULMONARY EMBOLISM BUT LATER REVEALED TO BE AN OVERDOSE   HE WAS THIRTY TWO  
POD1000000027_S0000095 AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE THIS   BUT YOU LOST A CHILD  
POD1000000027_S0000096 I KNOW  
POD1000000027_S0000097 RIGHT AROUND THEN  
POD1000000027_S0000098 JANUARY FIRST  
POD1000000027_S0000100 SHELLY WAS DEVASTATED  
POD1000000027_S0000101 I WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LIVING  
POD1000000027_S0000103 IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE FIGHT WITH V WAS A LAST   VOLATILE MOMENT BETWEEN DONALD AND SCOTT  
POD1000000027_S0000105 WHEN SCOTT DIED   DONALD STAYED WITH V   INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO HIS WIFE AS SHE GRIEVED   IT WAS TOO MUCH   SHE KICKED DON OUT OF THE HOUSE  
POD1000000027_S0000107 SHELLY NEEDED BREATHING ROOM AND I THINK DON HAD PUSHED THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE TOO FAR  
POD1000000027_S0000108 I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WE PROBABLY WERE GONNA BE GETTING A DIVORCE  
POD1000000027_S0000110 BUT SHELLY AND DONALD HAD BEEN TOGETHER TOO LONG   BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER   HAD TOO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MONEY INTERTWINED  
POD1000000027_S0000112 THEY DID NOT DIVORCE   THE SITUATION SIMPLY CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS DONALD SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME WITH V  
POD1000000027_S0000114 PLUS   SHELLY WAS STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE GIFTS   V POSTED PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM   V DRIVING THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RED FERRARI THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT HER  
POD1000000027_S0000115 AND THE RANGE ROVER   AND THE TWO BENTLEYS   SHELLY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT V A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DUPLEX  
POD1000000027_S0000116 WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD PAID FOR ALL THE CARS   AND HE PAID FOR THIS HOUSE I WAS FURIOUS  
POD1000000027_S0000117 IT WAS THAT ANGER SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH HER RETURNS ON THE FATEFUL DAY SHE THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND V   IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER   OR ARGUED   BUT THIS TIME   SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH  
POD1000000027_S0000118 AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I WAS GONNA SUE HER  
POD1000000027_S0000119 ON MARCH SEVEN   TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN   SHELLY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST V STIVIANO SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD  
POD1000000027_S0000121 DONALD AND SHELLY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO   PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST  
POD1000000027_S0000122 EVERY DIME THE STERLINGS SPENT COST EACH OF A THEM A NICKEL   THEREFORE   SHELLY ARGUED   THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS AS IT WAS HIS  
POD1000000027_S0000123 SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS   THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME   WELL   YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLINGS   CALLING A LAWYER IS HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING  
POD1000000027_S0000124 TO SAY THEY'RE LITIGIOUS IS LIKE SAYING THERE'S TRAFFIC ON THE FOUR OR FIVE   AND BESIDES   SUING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT HAD PROVEN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE STERLINGS OVER THE YEARS  
POD1000000027_S0000125 MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS OR THE STOMACH TO BATTLE THEM IN COURT   THEY'D SETTLE BEFORE THEY STARVED  
POD1000000027_S0000126 SHE KEPT SAYING TO DONALD   YOU BETTER HAVE HER DROP THE LAWSUIT   AND HE'D SAY   OH   SHE WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH WITH IT   BUT SHE'S JUST DOING IT FOR EFFECT   AND SHE SAYS   WELL   SHE BETTER DROP THE LAWSUIT  
POD1000000027_S0000127 BUT HERE'S HOW THE LAWSUIT THE COURTROOM PRODUCT OF A BEDROOM DISPUTE REALLY CAME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING   FOR SOME TIME NOW   V HAD BEEN RECORDING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD  
POD1000000027_S0000128 SWEETIE   I'M SORRY  
POD1000000027_S0000129 I'M SO SORRY   TOO   WE MADE A GIANT MISTAKE   BOTH OF US  
POD1000000027_S0000130 AND ACCORDING TO V AND HER LAWYER   DONALD WAS AWARE SHE WAS MAKING THE TAPES  
POD1000000027_S0000132 HE'D BEEN FORGETTING THINGS HE SAID TO HER   AND THE TAPES WERE A WAY OF REMINDING HIM  
POD1000000027_S0000134 PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE   PLEASE   PLEASE  
POD1000000027_S0000135 SHE'D RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS   OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS   A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE   BORING   EVEN   BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS   AND CAPTURED A SIDE OF DONALD THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR  
POD1000000027_S0000136 I GUESS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT   MAYBE YOU'RE STUPID  
POD1000000027_S0000137 NO MATTER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE TAPES WAS   THEY BECAME SOMETHING V COULD USE   AS BLACKMAIL   BECAUSE V   STIVIANO HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD  
POD1000000027_S0000138 SHE WANTED ME TO DROP THE LAWSUIT  
POD1000000027_S0000139 V SAYS TO DONALD   I WANT THAT BITCH WIFE OF YOURS LAWSUIT DISMISSED  
POD1000000027_S0000140 PIERCE O'DONNELL IS SHELLY STERLING'S LAWYER  
POD1000000027_S0000141 AND HE TRIED TO GET SHELLY TO DISMISS IT AND SHE WOULDN'T DO IT  
POD1000000027_S0000142 IF DONALD COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T FIX THE SITUATION   V DECIDED SHE WOULD TAKE MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS   IT WAS TIME TO USE THE TAPES  
POD1000000027_S0000143 TO REVEAL DONALD STERLING FOR WHO HE REALLY WAS

POD1000000027_S0000164 I WOULD HATE FOR STAPLE CENTER TO GET INVOLVED IN WHAT'S GOING ON  
POD1000000027_S0000165 THREE HOURS LATER   SHE GOT A RESPONSE  
POD1000000027_S0000166 MISTER STERLING SAID TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING   WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY ISSUES AT THE GAME

POD1000000027_S0000168 NO   YOU TELL MISTER STERLING THAT I DON'T NEED ANYTHING NOR DO I WANT ANYTHING   BUT THANKS FOR ASKING   LET THE GAMES BEGIN  
POD1000000027_S0000170 ATTACHED TO THE TEXT WAS AN AUDIO FILE   AND WHEN THE CLIPPERS EMPLOYEE OPENED THE FILE   SHE HEARD THIS  
POD1000000027_S0000171 IN YOUR LOUSY INSTAGRAM   YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOURSELF WITH WALKING WITH BLACK PEOPLE  
POD1000000027_S0000172 AND IT BOTHERS YOU  
POD1000000027_S0000173 YEAH IT BOTHERS ME A LOT THAT YOU WANT TO PROMOTE   BROADCAST THAT YOU'RE ASSOCIATING WITH BLACK PEOPLE   DO YOU HAVE TO  
POD1000000027_S0000174 YOU ASSOCIATE WITH BLACK PEOPLE  
POD1000000027_S0000175 I'M NOT YOU AND YOU'RE NOT ME   YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A DELICATE WHITE OR DELICATE LATINA GIRL  
POD1000000027_S0000176 I'M A MIXED GIRL  
POD1000000027_S0000178 IT WAS SHOCKING   THE CLIPPERS ASSISTANT IMMEDIATELY EMAILED THE FILE TO CLIPPERS PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER   AND THAT'S HOW SHELLY LEARNED ABOUT THE TAPE TOO  
POD1000000027_S0000179 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE TAPE WAS SENT TO THE CLIPPERS   UNTIL SOMEBODY AT A GAME TOLD ME THAT THEY SAID THEY RECEIVED A TAPE FROM HER  
POD1000000027_S0000180 AND I SAID   WELL   WHAT IS THE TAPE ABOUT   SO   I SAID TO ANDY   ANDY ROESER   I SAID   ANDY   WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS   AND HE SAYS   OH WELL   SHE'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING  
POD1000000027_S0000181 ROESER HAD WORKED FOR DONALD STERLING FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES   HE DID WHAT EVERYBODY LEARNS TO DO AFTER A WHILE STAY OUT OF THE REALLY UGLY STUFF  
POD1000000027_S0000182 DONALD AND SHELLY HAD CLEANED UP THEIR OWN MESSES FOR SIX DECADES   HE FIGURED THEY'D EVENTUALLY MAKE THIS ONE GO AWAY   TOO   BUT THEY DIDN'T   SHELLY TOLD HER LAWYERS ABOUT THE TAPES  
POD1000000027_S0000183 AND THEY IN TURN WENT TO V'S LAWYER AND DEMANDED TO HEAR THEM   AND THAT'S WHEN V STIVIANO MADE HER BIG MOVE  
POD1000000027_S0000185 I GOT A CALL BY A TRUSTED CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE WHO SAID   YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS  
POD1000000027_S0000186 MIKE WALTERS WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT T M Z AT THE TIME   NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN CELEBRITY NEWS SITE   THE BLAST  
POD1000000027_S0000187 THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY   WHO'S DONALD STERLING   I HAD HEARD THE NAME   I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT   BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS  
POD1000000027_S0000188 EVEN FOR SOMEONE FROM T M Z   WHOSE JOB WAS BREAKING THE INTERNET WITH THE JUICIEST   MOST CONTROVERSIAL STORIES   THIS FELT LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT  
POD1000000027_S0000190 I RECEIVED THE AUDIO AND SAID   OH MY GOD  
POD1000000027_S0000193 IT WAS THE MOST REPULSIVE   DISGUSTING  
POD1000000027_S0000195 UNBELIEVABLE  
POD1000000027_S0000197 AUDIO OR MOMENT THAT I'D EVER HEARD IN MY LIFETIME COME OUT OF SOMEBODY'S MOUTH THAT THEN   ONCE I REALIZED WHO THEY WERE   HOW MUCH IMPACT THAT MAY HAVE  
POD1000000027_S0000199 BUT NO ONE IN CLIPPERS WORLD SEEMED TO REALIZE  
POD1000000027_S0000201 THE FACT IS SHELLY AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION HEARD THE RECORDING AND DECIDED NOT TO ACT ON IT   OR WEREN'T APPALLED ENOUGH TO ACT ON IT   MAYBE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A SPLASH THIS TAPE COULD MAKE  
POD1000000027_S0000203 I THINK THIS DEALS WITH VERY TOUCHY SUBJECTS LIKE RACISM   SEXISM  
POD1000000027_S0000205 THINGS THAT TOUCH EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY   SO I KNEW   WITH ALL OF THAT COMBINED   WITH THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS ON TAPE  
POD1000000027_S0000207 AND   IF I COULD DO MY JOB PROPERLY   EVERYONE WAS GONNA HEAR IT   THAT THIS WOULD BE A GIGANTIC THING  
POD1000000027_S0000209 SO MIKE WALTERS CALLED UP THE N B A   THEIR NEW COMMISSIONER   ADAM SILVER   HAD BARELY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE MONTHS  
POD1000000027_S0000210 I ACTUALLY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ADAM SILVER UNTIL THAT DAY  
POD1000000027_S0000212 TURNS OUT NOT EVEN T M Z WAS GONNA RELEASE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITHOUT SOME DUE DILIGENCE  
POD1000000027_S0000214 THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY OF PEOPLE   AND THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST IN WHAT IS SAID IN THIS AUDIO   AND I THINK EVERYONE WILL AGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THIS  
POD1000000027_S0000215 THIS HAD TO BE HEARD   PERIOD  
POD1000000027_S0000217 AFTER CALLING THE LEAGUE   T M Z CALLED THE CLIPPERS TO LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE ABOUT TO PUBLISH A TAPE THAT WOULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO DONALD STERLING  
POD1000000027_S0000218 IF YOU'RE DONALD STERLING   THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME TO HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT YOU AS A RACIST   IF YOU'RE THE CLIPPERS   THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE MOMENT   DONALD STERLING'S CLIPPERS HAD BEEN A LAUGHING STOCK FOR DECADES  
POD1000000027_S0000220 BECAUSE HONESTLY   LIKE THESE CLIPPERS JOKES   IS SOMETHING WE   THEY'RE NOT EVEN JOKES THEY'RE STATEMENTS OF FACT  
POD1000000027_S0000222 IN THE THIRTY SOME ODD YEARS HE HAD OWNED THE TEAM   THEY'D ONLY MADE THE PLAYOFFS SIX TIMES   THEY'D NEVER EVEN MOVED PAST THE SEMIFINALS   THAT HAD ALL STARTED TO CHANGE IN THE LATE TWO THOUSANDS THOUGHT   THE TEAM HAD DRAFTED A STAR   BLAKE GRIFFIN  
POD1000000027_S0000223 N B A ROOKIE OF THE YEAR BLAKE GRIFFIN  
POD1000000027_S0000225 AND THEN ENDED UP WITH ANOTHER STAR   CHRIS PAUL

POD1000000027_S0000227 HAD YOU HEARD OF THE CLIPPERS BEFORE THIS

POD1000000027_S0000237 BUT NOW   THE CLIPPER CURSE WAS ABOUT TO REAR ITS HEAD YET AGAIN  
POD1000000027_S0000238 THE ONE THING I CAN ALWAYS RELY ON IS THAT THE CLIPPERS SCREW THINGS UP  
POD1000000027_S0000240 ONCE THE CLIPPERS STAFF FOUND OUT T M Z WAS GOING TO PUBLISH THE TAPE   ANDY ROESER WENT TO COACH DOC RIVERS   HE NEEDED HIM TO TALK TO THE TEAM BEFORE THE STORY BROKE

POD1000000027_S0000264 SUDDENLY THE PLAYOFF GAME BETWEEN THE TRAIL BLAZERS AND THE HOUSTON ROCKETS TAKING PLACE IN FRONT OF ME SEEMED COMPLETELY INSIGNIFICANT  
POD1000000027_S0000266 I FILED MY GAME STORY AND TRIED TO START WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND THIS ONE  
POD1000000027_S0000268 LIKE T M Z'S MIKE WALTERS   AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT TAPE   I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE HUGE  
POD1000000027_S0000269 THE DISGRACED CLIPPERS OWNER IN THE SPOTLIGHT  
POD1000000027_S0000270 STERLING HAS A LONG HISTORY OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR  
POD1000000027_S0000272 IT'S OBVIOUSLY APPALLING IT'S VERY DISTURBING   BUT UM TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU I WASN'T TOO SURPRISED  
POD1000000027_S0000273 WITHIN HOURS   THE AUDIO OF DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO V STIVIANO HAD GONE VIRAL  
POD1000000027_S0000275 T M Z'S CAMERAMEN AND REPORTERS SWARMED THE LOBBY OF THE CLIPPERS TEAM HOTEL   THEY HAD BOOKED SEVERAL ROOMS AT THE FOUR SEASONS IN ADVANCE SO THEY COULD LEGALLY BE INSIDE THE PRIVATE PROPERTY  
POD1000000027_S0000276 OUTSIDE THE HOTEL WAS EVEN MORE CHAOTIC   THE WHOLE WORLD WANTED A REACTION   CLIPPERS TEAM SECURITY ADVISED PLAYERS AND STAFFERS TO STAY INSIDE THEIR HOTEL ROOMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE   THEY WERE ON LOCKDOWN  
POD1000000027_S0000277 WHEN IT CAME OUT   I REMEMBER IT JUST BEING CHAOS   IT JUST   FROM THEN ON   IT WAS JUST AH THAT'S ALL ANYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT  
POD1000000027_S0000278 BY MORNING   LEBRON JAMES THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE LEAGUE WAS SAYING THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR A PERSON LIKE DONALD STERLING IN THE N B A  
POD1000000027_S0000280 AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY   ADAM SILVER WAS FACING HIS FIRST REAL CRISIS  
POD1000000027_S0000281 N B A COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER SITTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS ADDRESSING THE COMMENTS MADE BY DONALD STERLING  
POD1000000027_S0000282 THE AUDIO RECORDING POSTED BY T M Z IS TRULY OFFENSIVE AND DISTURBING   AND WE INTEND TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE  
POD1000000027_S0000283 SILVER LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION WITHIN HOURS  
POD1000000027_S0000284 I'M NOT YET PREPARED TO DISCUSS ANY POTENTIAL SANCTIONS AGAINST DONALD STERLING   WE WILL HOWEVER MOVE EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY IN OUR INVESTIGATION  
POD1000000027_S0000286 IF IT WAS STERLING ON THOSE TAPES   IF THEY HADN'T BEEN DOCTORED OR ALTERED   SILVER KNEW HE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY   THE LEAGUE WAS OUTRAGED  
POD1000000027_S0000287 BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THESE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS   STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON  
POD1000000027_S0000289 IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF V STIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC  
POD1000000027_S0000290 THE GUY WHO'D TURNED THE LAKERS INTO A DYNASTY   WHO'D FOUGHT OFF H I V   THAT'S THE GUY DONALD STERLING TOLD HIS MISTRESS WASN'T WELCOME AT HIS GAMES  
POD1000000027_S0000291 PLAIN AND SIMPLE   WHEN YOU HEARD THOSE COMMENTS MAGIC   WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION  
POD1000000027_S0000292 THAT WAS REALLY UPSET   YOU KNOW UM   YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HURT I WAS   HE SHOULDN'T OWN A TEAM ANY MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE AFRICAN AMERICANS RENTING HIS APARTMENTS   COMING TO THE GAMES  
POD1000000027_S0000293 AND PLAYING FOR HIM   AND COACHING FOR HIM   THIS IS THIS IS BAD FOR EVERYBODY   IT'S BAD FOR AMERICA   AND SO I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT  
POD1000000027_S0000294 EVEN THE FAMOUSLY APOLITICAL MICHAEL JORDAN VOICED HIS OUTRAGE  
POD1000000027_S0000295 MICHAEL JORDAN WEIGHED IN THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE N B A OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THE KIND OF RACISM AND HATRED THAT MR   STERLING ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED   WE CANNOT TOLERATE   MUST NOT TOLERATE   DISCRIMINATION AT ANY LEVEL  
POD1000000027_S0000296 BUT THE STORY WAS BIGGER THAN THE N B A   IT REVEALED SOMETHING RAW AND UGLY IT TRIGGERED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  
POD1000000027_S0000298 IT'S LIKE WHAT ONE OF THE PAPARAZZI WHO WAS TAILING DONALD AND SHELLY TOLD ME   IT HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS   SEX   MONEY   SPORTS   POLITICS   GREED   RACISM  
POD1000000027_S0000299 IT HAD EVERYTHING   IT EVEN HAD THE VISOR   YOU REMEMBER THE VISOR   THAT DAFT PUNK WELDING MASK MEETS FLORIDA GRANDMA VISOR THAT V STIVIANO WORE ANY TIME SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE HER HOUSE  
POD1000000027_S0000300 BUT STILL SAY NOTHING IS V   STIVIANO NOT LATE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN SHE ARRIVED HOME OR WHEN SHE LEFT TONIGHT WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES BUT COLOR COORDINATED FACE SHIELDS  
POD1000000027_S0000301 THE WOMAN WHO SET THIS WHOLE THING OFF   WAS OUT THERE ROLLERBLADING FOR THE PAPARAZZI  
POD1000000027_S0000302 HAVE YOU TALKED TO MR   STERLING   CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE MASK  
POD1000000027_S0000303 THIS WAS A FULL ON MEDIA CIRCUS  
POD1000000027_S0000304 WHY ARE YOU WEARING THE SHIELD   WHY ARE YOU HOLDING A MICROPHONE  
POD1000000027_S0000305 I DON'T KNOW   IT'S MY JOB WELL THEN   IT'S MY JOB  
POD1000000027_S0000306 BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND   THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT STERLING  
POD1000000027_S0000308 I SUSPECT THAT THE N B A IS GONNA DEEPLY CONCERNED AND IN RESOLVING THIS   YOU KNOW WE THE UNITED STATES UM CONTINUES TO WRESTLE WITH A LEGACY OF OF RACE  
POD1000000027_S0000309 THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE   NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY   BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER   MORE SHAMEFUL  
POD1000000027_S0000311 A PLANTATION MENTALITY THAT'S AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY  
POD1000000027_S0000313 THAT'S AN N B A OWNER   A MAN WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS   GOING ON FOR MORE THAN NINE MINUTES   SPEWING THE MOST VILE OF RACIST THOUGHTS   A WHITE OWNER WHOSE TWENTYMAN ROSTER WAS STACKED WITH A MAJORITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS  
POD1000000027_S0000314 INCLUDING RYAN HOLLINS  
POD1000000027_S0000315 THOSE WORDS HURT   WHEN YOU HEAR I DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT   WELL THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT PLAY FOR YOU   THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BUY YOUR TICKETS   THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BLEED JUST LIKE YOU   BRUH  
POD1000000027_S0000317 EARTHQUAKES   BOTH REAL AND METAPHORICAL   HAPPENED SUDDENLY BUT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT SUDDEN   THE TREMOR IS A PRODUCT OF TENSIONS THAT BUILD UP FOR YEARS UNTIL THE FAULT LINES SIMPLY BREAK  
POD1000000027_S0000318 LOS ANGELES SITS ON TWO FAULT LINES THE SAN ANDREAS AND RACE   ALL OF US KNOW IT   WE LIVE WITH IT   DONALD STERLING WAS ANOTHER  
POD1000000027_S0000319 ANYONE WHO PLAYED FOR HIM   OR WORKED FOR HIM   OR COVERED HIM IN THE PRESS   OR LIVED IN ONE OF HIS HUNDREDS OF APARTMENTS   ON THE ONE HAND KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE BLEW UP   THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH STERLING WERE WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED  
POD1000000027_S0000320 BUT LIKE MOST INSANELY WEALTHY WHITE MEN IN AMERICA   DONALD HAD MANAGED TO WIGGLE   BULLY AND FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF ALL   HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY HIS LEVERAGE AND POWER OUTLAST HIS ADVERSARIES AND WIN   YOU CAN CALL IT THAT  
POD1000000027_S0000321 BUT THIS TIME FELT DIFFERENT  
POD1000000027_S0000323 I REMEMBER I HAD SAID   AH THIS IS REALLY BAD   REALLY BAD   AND I I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN   I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT   IT WAS LIKE SHOCK  
POD1000000027_S0000325 THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WERE SHOCKED   BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED  
POD1000000029_S0000001 FACEBOOK'S HAD FIFTEEN MONTHS OF QUOTE FRESH HELL BUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION STILL USE IT OR INSTAGRAM OR WHATSAPP MESSENGER EVERYDAY  
POD1000000029_S0000002 FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND JACK STEWARD INFORMALLY WOOD  
POD1000000029_S0000004 DESPITE THE PRIVACY SCANDALS   THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THE ACCUSATIONS OF DESTROYING DEMOCRACY   THIS WEEK FACEBOOK REPORTED ITS ADVERTISING REVENUE AND GLOBAL USERS ARE GROWING  
POD1000000029_S0000005 IN THIS WEEK'S QUALITY ASSURANCE   WE TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO WHY   IN ITS EARLY YEARS   FACEBOOK PRIORITIZED GROWTH OVER EVERYTHING ELSE  
POD1000000029_S0000006 NEARLY EVERY CRISIS FACEBOOK NOW FACES STEMS FROM THAT   NICHOLAS THOMPSON EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED SAYS THAT'S LEFT MANAGEMENT'S NAVIGATE METAPHORICAL MIND FIELD  
POD1000000029_S0000007 THERE WAS A LOT OF UNEXPLODED ORDINANCE THAT THEY WERE INEVITABLY GOING TO STEP ON IT SOME POINT  
POD1000000029_S0000008 HE'S AN AUTHOR ON THE MAGAZINE'S LATEST COVER STORY   WHICH GOES BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE TROUBLED COMPANY   HE SAYS FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY SOLID FOR COUPLE OF REASONS  
POD1000000029_S0000009 NUMBER ONE   THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS MODEL THEY CAME UP WITH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER   AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LOTS OF CHANGES   THEY JUST BUILT AN AMAZING BUSINESS MODEL   AND THE MARGINAL COSTS OF BRINGING IN NEW ADVERTISERS ARE VERY LOW  
POD1000000029_S0000010 SECONDLY   ONE OF THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG EVER MADE WAS TO BUY INSTAGRAM   AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK   OR IF THEY DISTRUST FACEBOOK   THEY DON'T DISTRUST INSTAGRAM   SO INSTAGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW  
POD1000000029_S0000011 SO THEY MAKE LOTS OF MONEY OFF OF CORE FACEBOOK   THEY HAVE LOTS OF USER GROWTH ON INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP   AND THE BUSINESS IS DOING GREAT  
POD1000000029_S0000012 YOU WOULD THINK AT SOME POINT THAT MAYBE ADVERTISERS WOULD START TO PUSH BACK   I MEAN IF FACEBOOK'S REPUTATION HAS REALLY TAKEN THIS REALLY HUGE DENT THAT IT APPEARS IT HAS   WHY DO PEOPLE STILL WANT TO ADVERTISE WITH IT  
POD1000000029_S0000013 WELL BECAUSE THE ADVERTISING CONTINUES TO WORK   IF AT SOME POINTS PEOPLE HAVE AN ICKY FEELING WHEN THEY USE FACEBOOK AND THEREFORE THE ADS ARE LESS EFFECTIVE   THEN ADVERTISERS WILL LEAVE  
POD1000000029_S0000014 BUT AT THIS MOMENT   FACEBOOK ALLOWS YOU TO VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGET SPECIFIC USERS IN WAYS THAT YOU CANNOT ON OTHER PLATFORMS   AND FOR LOTS OF ADVERTISERS   THAT'S JUST A DEAL THAT'S TOO GOOD TO PASS UP  
POD1000000029_S0000015 NOW FACEBOOK IS ANTICIPATING ONCE UP TO A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION   WE HEARD THAT FROM THIS WEEK   ABOUT HOW IT'S HANDLED SOME OF THESE PRIVACY ISSUES  
POD1000000029_S0000016 WILL THEY EVEN FEEL THAT IS THE QUESTION   THEY HAVE SO MUCH CASH ON HAND   IS IS IT A BIG DEAL  
POD1000000029_S0000017 NO   SO FACEBOOK PUT OUT IN THEIR EARNINGS CALL   THEY SAID THEY ANTICIPATE A THREE TO FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE   I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THE F T C HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH THEM OR IF FACEBOOK IS JUST TRYING TO SET EXPECTATIONS AS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC  
POD1000000029_S0000018 I WOULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT FACEBOOK IS HIT WITH A TEN BILLION DOLLAR FINE OR A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR FINE   REGARDLESS   TO YOUR QUESTION   EVEN IF IT IS AT THE HIGHER END   WHETHER IT'S FIVE OR TEN OR TWENTY   IT'S TINY  
POD1000000029_S0000019 THEIR MARKET CAP IS UP   I BELIEVE   FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AS WE TALK THIS MORNING   SO IT'S NOT A HUGE HIT TO THEM   OBVIOUSLY   THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAN NOT HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS   BUT THEY WILL BE FINE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS NUMBER COMES OUT AT  
POD1000000029_S0000020 THE THING THEY REALLY WORRY ABOUT IS ANTITRUST   IF THERE IS ANTITRUST REGULATION AND IT COMES DOWN HARD ON THEM   THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET DROP DRAMATICALLY  
POD1000000029_S0000021 WHAT ARE THE STAKES FOR FACEBOOK'S LEADERSHIP AROUND ALL OF THESE SCANDALS   THAT THE FAKE NEWS   THE OFFENSIVE CONTENT   THE PRIVACY   YOU YOU KNOW YOU DETAIL THAT THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND MODERATORS NOW   AH DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK  
POD1000000029_S0000022 YES   ABSOLUTELY   FACEBOOK IS TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK   SO THERE ARE TWO REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS UM IN THERE   SO NUMBER ONE IS DO THEY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK   ABSOLUTELY   ARE THEY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO COUNTER FAKE NEWS AND ALL OF THE MANIPULATION ON THE PLATFORM  
POD1000000029_S0000023 ABSOLUTELY   WHAT ARE THE STAKES TO THEIR BUSINESS   THEY ARE A VERY HIGH   IF SCANDAL CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY   THERE COULD BE REAL CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD   WHAT ARE THE STAKES SPECIFICALLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT   MEANING MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG   TWO PEOPLE WHO WE MOST ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMPANY  
POD1000000029_S0000024 FOR ZUCKERBERG   HE'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO   HE HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE SHARES   HE'S APPOINTED HIS FRIENDS AS BOARD MEMBERS   HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION  
POD1000000029_S0000025 WHENEVER HE WANTS TO GO AND RUN THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE OR JUST GO BE AN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT LEADER OR DO BILL GATES TYPE THINGS   HE WILL GO CHOOSE TO DO THAT   FOR SANDBERG   IT'S TOUGHER  
POD1000000029_S0000026 AND THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE SHE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED OR WHERE SHE MIGHT BE IN BIG TROUBLE   ZUCKERBERG HAS EXPRESSED HIS LOYALTY TO HER  
POD1000000029_S0000027 BUT AS THE SCANDALS MULTIPLIED AND AS THEY STARTED TO TOUCH HER IN A WAY THEY NEVER HAD BEFORE   IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER POSITION WAS AT RISK   AND IT IS ALSO CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE PUBLIC REPUTATION OF BOTH OF THEM HAS DROPPED  
POD1000000029_S0000028 A YEAR AGO   WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THEM AS POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES   NOW THERE'S NOT A CHANCE  
POD1000000029_S0000029 WHAT ABOUT THE MORALE IN THE WIDER COMPANY IN THE WAKE OF ALL OF THIS   DO YOU GET THE FEELING FROM THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO AND YOUR REPORTING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE FAIRLY SATISFIED THERE   AND THAT I'M LAUGHING EVEN AS I SAY THAT   OR IS THERE A WHOLE LOT OF INTERNAL CHAOS AT THIS COMPANY  
POD1000000029_S0000030 THERE IS A LOT MORE EMPLOYEE DISSATISFACTION THAN THERE WAS TWO YEARS  
POD1000000029_S0000031 AGO   THERE ARE LOTS OF EMPLOYEES WHO I TALK TO THERE WHO SAY   OH   THIS PLACE IS GREAT   IT'S COOL   YOU KNOW THE MEDIA HATES US   BUT THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM   I'M HAPPY   UM AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAY   YOU KNOW WE DESERVE A LOT OF THE HATRED   WE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES  
POD1000000029_S0000032 WE TRAMPLED ON PEOPLE'S PRIVACY   AND YOU KNOW I REGRET ALL THAT WE'VE DONE   I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING TO WORK THERE   AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE HALO THAT IT DID TWO YEARS AGO  
POD1000000029_S0000033 THEY STILL PAY YOU WELL   THE FACT THAT THE STOCK CONTINUES TO GO UP IS GREAT   PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPTIONS  
POD1000000029_S0000034 BUT IT IS A LESS EXCITING PLACE TO WORK   AND THAT IS ONE OF THE TRUE RISKS FOR THE COMPANY AND ONE OF THE MOST ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR FACEBOOK  
POD1000000029_S0000035 AH DID ANY PART IN THIS REPORTING   PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW GIVE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE SPENT ON FACEBOOK DIRECTLY NOW   DID ANYTHING REALLY SURPRISE YOU  
POD1000000029_S0000036 THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC STORY THAT STUNNED ME   AND THAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE TWO FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM   KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER  
POD1000000029_S0000037 AND WHEN FRED VOGELSTEIN AND I STARTED REPORTING THE STORY   AND WE MADE A LIST OF THE MYSTERIES WE WANTED TO SOLVE AND THAT WAS AT THE VERY TOP   WHY HAD THEY LEFT   IT SEEMED STRANGE   THEY HAD LEFT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEPTEMBER  
POD1000000029_S0000038 NO ONE KNEW WHY   AND LATE IN THE REPORTING   YOU KNOW MONTHS INTO REPORTING THE STORY   WE FINALLY LEARNED THE FULL STORY   AND THAT IS THAT   ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM   THEY HAD GROWN FRUSTRATED WITH ZUCKERBERG'S INCREASED MEDDLING  
POD1000000029_S0000039 THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT INSTAGRAM WAS GONNA BE FURTHER MERGED WITH WHATSAPP AND WITH FACEBOOK   AND THERE WAS REAL TENSION OVER INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH  
POD1000000029_S0000040 AND THERE WAS A SENSE AMONG SOME PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK THAT INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH WAS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE FACEBOOK   AND THAT LED TO ALL KINDS OF TENSIONS AND THEN A BIG FIGHT AT THE END OF JULY AND A MOMENT WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG  
POD1000000029_S0000041 ACCORDING TO PEOPLE WHO OBSERVING ALL OF THIS   ASKED ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES TO DRAW UP A LIST OF ALL THE WAYS THAT FACEBOOK SUPPORTED INSTAGRAM   THE WAY IT DROVE USERS TOWARDS INSTAGRAM  
POD1000000029_S0000042 AND THEN HE GAVE THE LIST TO KEVIN SYSTROM AND SAID   WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL OF THESE   AND ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY   SYSTROM REACTED QUITE BADLY TO THAT AND THEN WENT ON PATERNITY LEAVE   CAME BACK AND SAID   I'M DONE HERE  
POD1000000029_S0000043 AND SO THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO US WAS THAT THE DEPARTURE OF SYSTROM AND KRIEGER   WHICH HADN'T COME OUT BEFORE   WAS MUCH TENSER   MUCH TENSER THAN I HAD BELIEVED WHEN I BEGAN REPORTING THE STORY  
POD1000000029_S0000044 NICK THOMPSON   EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED FOR CONTEXT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE WOULD BE A RECORD TECH PENALTY IN THE U S BITTING THE TWENTY TWO MILLION THE GOOGLE HAVE TO PAY IN TWENTY TWELVE  
POD1000000029_S0000046 AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS A GOOD EXPLAINER ON WHY BOTH FACEBOOK AND THE F T C WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A CHUNKY FINE   ONE ENDS UP LOOKING STRONG   THE OTHER LOOKS ACCOUNTABLE   BUT REALLY   NOTHING MUCH CHANGES  
POD1000000029_S0000047 EUROPEAN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN TOUGHER ON TECH COMPANIES   GOOGLE   FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ALL HAVE TO DO MORE TO TACKLE FAKE NEWS TO SATISFY THEM   AND THEY WANT TO SEE PROGRESS AHEAD OF E U ELECTIONS NEXT MONTH   THAT'S ACCORDING TO REUTERS  
POD1000000029_S0000048 AND EVEN CANADA'S GETTING IN ON THE ACTION   ACCORDING TO THE C B C   THIS WEEK   PRIVACY REGULATORS THERE SAY FACEBOOK BROKE SEVERAL LAWS OVER UNAUTHORIZED DATA ACCESS   THEY PLAN TO TAKE THE COMPANY TO COURT  
POD1000000029_S0000049 IF YOU ENJOYED MARK ZUCKERBERG'S TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS HERE IN THE U S   WITH HIS ZINGING COMEBACKS LIKE SENATOR   WE RUN ADS   THEN MAYBE YOU'LL ENJOY HEARING MORE DIRECTLY FROM MR ZUCKERBERG HIMSELF  
POD1000000029_S0000050 I MEAN FACEBOOK WAS ACCUSED OF NOT BEING OPEN ENOUGH   I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW DEEP INTO THE HEADS OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET   BUT ZUCK HAS A PODCAST NOW   I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU LISTEN   I'M JUST GIVING YOU THIS INFORMATION  
POD1000000029_S0000051 IT'S CALLED TECH AND SOCIETY WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG   JUST YEAH DON'T AT ME   MY PUDDY PRODUCE THIS WEEKS MARKETPLACE TECH ALONG WITH STEPHANIE HUGHES AND EACH ROW IS A SENIOR PRODUCER  
POD1000000029_S0000053 I'M JACK STEWART FOR NOW THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH   THIS IS A P M  
POD1000000029_S0000055 THIS IS A P M  
POD1000000033_S0000001 IF YOU WANT TO GET BROADBAND ACCESS TO EVERY STATE   YOU GOTTA KNOW THE LOCAL LAWS   FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA   THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH   DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY   I'M MOLLY WOOD  
POD1000000033_S0000003 THE DIGITAL ECONOMY   AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT OVER HERE   DEPENDS PRETTY HEAVILY ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNET   AND THAT IS STILL NOT A SOLVED PROBLEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES  
POD1000000033_S0000004 OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET   WHICH IS DEFINED AS TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND OR HIGHER   THAT'S ACCORDING TO RESEARCH RELEASED TUESDAY BY THE N P D GROUP  
POD1000000033_S0000005 THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS HAS AN INITIATIVE DEDICATED TO FIGURING OUT WHY THIS IS THE CASE   TODAY   THE ORGANIZATION'S BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE IS LAUNCHING A NEW TOOL   THAT LETS ANYONE BROWSE THROUGH BROADBAND POLICIES AND FUNDING IN ANY STATE IN THE U S  
POD1000000033_S0000006 IT SORTS THE INFORMATION IN CATEGORIES LIKE FUNDING   COMPETITION AND REGULATION   INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS   AND BROADBAND DEFINITIONS  
POD1000000033_S0000007 LIKE IN ALABAMA   FOR EXAMPLE   BROADBAND SPEED IS DEFINED AS ONLY TEN MEGABITS FOR SECONDS   IF YOUR NETWORK IS BUSY   THAT'S BARELY FAST ENOUGH TO STREAM NETFLIX AND HIGH DEATH  
POD1000000033_S0000008 KATHRYN DE WIT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS   SHE TOLD ME   STATE POLICY IS A HUGE DEAL   WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING BROADBAND ACCESS  
POD1000000033_S0000009 STATE POLICY MATTERS BECAUSE LACK OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND IS A NATIONAL ISSUE   BUT IT IS FELT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL   AND STATES HAVE TAKEN A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO CLOSING GAPS IN ACCESS   PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS  
POD1000000033_S0000010 WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN LEGISLATION SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN   UM   AND WHAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS NOT ONLY DO STATE POLICY MAKERS SEE AND FEEL THAT IMMEDIATE URGENCY OF AH   LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS  
POD1000000033_S0000011 THAT'S THEY'RE SAYING IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINGS LIKE EDUCATION   HEALTH CARE AND AH   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS   BUT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING   THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OUR STATE TO LOOK LIKE   THEY'RE SETTING GOALS   AND THEN THEY'RE LAYING OUT A PATH AND A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS  
POD1000000033_S0000012 LET'S JUST DIVE INTO SOME OF WHAT IS IN THE TOOL   SOME OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES ARE TAKING   LIKE   COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES MIGHT HAVE TAKEN  
POD1000000033_S0000013 SO GOING INTO THIS RESEARCH   WE KNEW THAT STATES AH FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN INCREASING ACCESS TO BROADBAND   AH BUT WE LEARNED THAT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING SIMILAR APPROACHES BUT ADAPTING AH THEM TO THEIR NEEDS   THAT'S REALLY WHERE THOSE CATEGORIES CAME FROM   THOSE GROUPINGS  
POD1000000033_S0000014 AH   IF YOU LOOK AT GOALS   FOR EXAMPLE   AH   YOU HAVE STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THEIR STATEWIDE BROADBAND GOALS ARE FOCUSED ON BORDER TO BORDER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE  
POD1000000033_S0000015 THEN YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA AH   THAT HAS A GOAL TO CONNECT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND EACH ONE OF ITS ROUGHLY TWENTY REGIONS  
POD1000000033_S0000016 HOW DO YOU HOPE THAT A TOOL LIKE THIS CAN HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF BROADBAND ACCESS  
POD1000000033_S0000017 WELL   THIS TOOL IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STEP IN OUR ONGOING RESEARCH ON HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING GAPS IN BROADBAND ACCESS   SO FOR US   THIS WAS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT FIFTY STATE LANDSCAPE OF BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT LAWS  
POD1000000033_S0000018 AND IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR OUR NEXT LEVEL OF RESEARCH   WHICH IS A DEEPER EXAMINATION OF HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN ACCESS  
POD1000000033_S0000019 WHAT WE HOPE   THOUGH   IS THAT AH USERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL TO LEARN WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT  
POD1000000033_S0000020 KATHRYN DE WIT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS   WE'VE GOT A LINK TO THAT NEW TOOL AND SOME ANALYSIS ABOUT SPENDING PER STATE AT OUR WEBSITE   MARKETPLACE TECH DOT ORG  
POD1000000033_S0000022 AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS   SO THIS TOOL IS SUPER NEW OBVIOUSLY   AND PEW HOPES THAT POLICYMAKERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL JUMP IN AND START CREATING SOME MORE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON AND OF COURSE THEY'LL BE PUBLISHING THEIR OWN PIECES  
POD1000000033_S0000023 THE FIRST ONE THAT I MENTIONED THERE IS ABOUT HOW STATES FUND THEIR BROADBAND PROJECTS   WHETHER IT'S GRANTS OR LOANS OR GENERAL FUNDS KIND OF THINGS   OR SOME CREATIVE FUNDING  
POD1000000033_S0000024 APPARENTLY ILLINOIS MAKES INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS PAY INTO A SPECIAL COFFER CALLED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ELIMINATION FUND   AND IT USES THAT TO PAY FOR BROADBAND BUILDOUTS  
POD1000000033_S0000025 AND IN VIRGINIA   A LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH TOBACCO PRODUCERS IS PAYING TO BUILD MORE INTERNET  
POD1000000033_S0000026 LOOK I'M NOT SAYING THIS ISN'T A LITTLE WONKY OVER HERE   BUT IT IS INTERESTING   ALSO   I GOT TO BE HONEST   I'M STILL HUNG UP ON THAT TEN MEGABITS PER SECOND IN ALABAMA   AND PROBABLY SOME OTHER STATES   TOO   I HAVEN'T MADE IT THROUGH THE ENTIRE TOOL YET  
POD1000000033_S0000027 BUT ALABAMA'S REGULATION ALSO SAYS I S P'S CAN CALL THEIR UPLOAD SPEEDS BROADBAND AT ONE MEGABIT PER SECOND   SO BASICALLY   IF YOU ARE AT HOME TRYING TO UPLOAD SOME PHOTOS TO FACEBOOK OR ANYTHING TO THE CLOUD EVER  
POD1000000033_S0000028 YOU'D BE DOING THAT AT SPEEDS TEN TIMES SLOWER THAN THE SLOWEST FOUR G CELLPHONE CONNECTION   SET IT AND FORGET IT   CAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL NIGHT  
POD1000000033_S0000029 ANOTHER SPEED QUESTION IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT EVEN THOUGH PEW IS USING THE TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND SPEED GUIDELINE   WHICH IS SET BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION   NETWORK CONGESTION USUALLY MEANS ACTUAL SPEEDS ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT FAST  
POD1000000033_S0000030 AND AGAIN   A FOUR G PHONE CONNECTION IS FASTER THAN THAT ON THE BEST PROVIDERS  
POD1000000033_S0000031 IT IS SUCH A BIG DISCREPANCY THAT WHILE PEW SAYS TWENTY ONE MILLION AMERICANS DON'T HAVE BROADBAND   MICROSOFT PUT OUT ITS OWN MAP OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS BACK IN APRIL  
POD1000000033_S0000032 IT SAID THE REAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHOUT APPROPRIATELY FAST INTERNET ACCESS FOR TODAY'S ECONOMY IS MORE LIKE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE  
POD1000000033_S0000034 I'M MOLLY WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH  
POD1000000033_S0000036 THIS IS A P M  
POD1000000038_S0000001 LET'S TAKE A BREAK FROM REAL LIFE FOR A MOMENT TO VISIT THE SOMEWHAT NEAR FUTURE ON T V  
POD1000000038_S0000002 ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT'S KINDA DARK TOO  
POD1000000038_S0000003 FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA   THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DE MYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY   I'M MOLLY WOOD  
POD1000000038_S0000005 THE B B C H B O SHOW YEARS AND YEARS COMBINES THE POLITICS   ECONOMY AND TECH OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND IMAGINES HOW IT ALL MIGHT EVOLVE OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS  
POD1000000038_S0000006 EMMA THOMPSON IS IN IT AS A CELEBRITY BRITISH POLITICIAN WITH AUTOCRATIC LEANINGS   BUT MAINLY THE SHOW FOLLOWS A FAMILY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE WORLD CHANGING AROUND THEM  
POD1000000038_S0000007 RUSSELL T   DAVIES CREATED AND WROTE YEARS AND YEARS   HE'S ALSO WORKED ON SHOWS DOCTOR WHO   TORCHWOOD AND CREATED QUEER AS FOLK  
POD1000000038_S0000008 HE SAID THE TECH IN YEARS AND YEARS IS LIKE LIFE   IT'S COMPLICATED  
POD1000000038_S0000010 SHOW GOOD AND BAD   I THINK SOME OF THE SADDEST MOMENTS IS IS YOU YOU HAVE A WORLD WAR BEING ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION   AND THE LITTLE FIVE   SIX YEAR OLD KIDS JUST SIT AND STARING INTO THEIR PHONES PLAYING THEIR GAMES  
POD1000000038_S0000011 SO YES   THERE'S BAD STUFF   BUT THAT'S VERY EASY TO TALK ABOUT   AND YET   THERE'S VERY   VERY GOOD STUFF   I TELL YOU   ACTUALLY   WHEN I MADE THE CHOICE TO CENTER THIS AROUND A FAMILY  
POD1000000038_S0000012 THAT CAME FROM ONE OF THE GOOD SIDES OF CURRENT TECH   WHICH IS VERY SIMPLY THE WHATSAPP GROUP   I'M ONE OF THREE KIDS AND TWO SISTERS HAVE TWO KIDS EACH   WE'RE A NICE FAMILY   WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER   WE GET ALONG  
POD1000000038_S0000013 BUT UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO   AS MY NIECES HAVE GROWN UP   TWO   THREE YEARS AGO   I WOULD HAVE TEXTED THEM TWICE A YEAR HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND MERRY CHRISTMAS   NOW   OH MY GOD I WENT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT AND I CAME BACK TO THE WHATSAPP GROUP   FIFTY THREE MESSAGES  
POD1000000038_S0000015 BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD COOKED A LASAGNA WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH   SO YES   THERE'S GOOD STUFF   IF YOU CHOOSE EITHER GOOD OR EITHER BAD   YOU'RE NOT MAKE IT RIGHT   YOU'VE GOT TO GET BOTH IN THERE   BECAUSE IN THE END   IT'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY   IT'S IT'S THE PEOPLE  
POD1000000038_S0000016 WELL   IT'S GREAT   BECAUSE SOME OF THE TECH FEELS REALLY IMMEDIATE   LIKE A HEADBAND THAT PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC SORT OF SNAPCHAT FILTER FOR YOUR FACE THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD   IT'S FUTURISTIC   BUT IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY REALISTIC  
POD1000000038_S0000017 YES YES I THINK IF THAT WAS INVENTED TOMORROW   WE'D ALL GO AND BUY ONE   I MEAN I FIND THOSE FILTERS FASCINATING  
POD1000000038_S0000019 SENDS EACH OTHER PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES LOOKING LIKE A DOG  
POD1000000038_S0000021 RASH OF INSTAGRAM FILTERS   LIKE WHAT DOG ARE YOU OR WHAT CAKE ARE YOU   I'M CERTAINLY A BATTENBERG   BUT I LOVE THOSE FILTERS   AND I'M FASCINATED BY THE WAY WE LOVE THOSE FILTERS  
POD1000000038_S0000022 AND SO THE MOMENT SOMEONE INVENTS A FILTER YOU CAN SEE IN THE REAL WORLD   NOT JUST ON YOUR PHONE   OH MY GOD I WOULD BE PHONING YOU FROM MY PALACE ON THE MOON  
POD1000000038_S0000023 DO YOU HAVE CONFLICTING YOU KNOW FEELINGS ABOUT TECH   OR IS IT LIKE SO MANY THINGS WHERE IT JUST REFLECTS THE REAL WORLD  
POD1000000038_S0000024 YEAH IT'S INTERESTING AH   I THINK IT'S BOTH   I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINING   BUT ENTERTAINING DOESN'T MEAN BEING GLIB OR DAFT   UM I THINK I'M GETTING OLDER   I THINK MY STUFF IS FULL OF WARNINGS NOW   TO BE HONEST   IT'S FUNNY   NOW I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EDIT OF MY NEXT DRAMA  
POD1000000038_S0000026 H B O MAX OVER THERE WHICH IS ABOUT THE AIDS CRISIS OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES  
POD1000000038_S0000028 I'VE JUST WATCHED AN EDIT OF AN EPISODE WARNING ABOUT VIRUSES   AND WE STEP OUT OF OUR FRONT DOORS AND THERE'S A VIRUS ON THE LOOSE   IT'S YOU CAN'T LEARN THOSE LESSONS FROM HISTORY ENOUGH   STRANGELY   WHAT A WORLD  
POD1000000038_S0000029 I WAS TELLING PEOPLE THAT I'M TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT IN A DARKER TIMELINE   LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME   RIGHT   LIKE YOU FAST FORWARD IN THESE EPISODES AND INCREASINGLY TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN   BUT ALSO  
POD1000000038_S0000030 PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING THEIR NORMAL LIVES   TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE  
POD1000000038_S0000031 YES   THAT'S RIGHT   I MEAN IT'S IT WAS QUITE A HARD SHOW TO SELL INITIALLY   WITH ITS CONCEPT OF MOVING FORWARD IN TIME AND EVERY EPISODE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR   UM BUT ACTUALLY I SAT THERE SAYING  
POD1000000038_S0000033 BEEN QUESTIONED ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN TIMES  
POD1000000038_S0000035 DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR IN EVERY EPISODE   DOWNTON ABBEY  
POD1000000038_S0000036 AND SO DID UPSTAIRS   DOWNSTAIRS MANY YEARS AGO   IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A FORM OF DRAMA I'VE INVENTED   IT'S SIMPLY THAT THIS DRAMA IS GOING TO THE FUTURE AH BY A YEAR EVERY EPISODE THAT HAD PEOPLE SCARED   BUT IN TERMS OF DRAMA   IN TERMS OF HOW THE CHARACTERS ARE GETTING ON   WHO LOVES WHO  
POD1000000038_S0000037 WHO'S GOING OUT WITH WHO   WHO'S CROSS WITH WHO   WHO LOVES WHO   TO TAKE YEARLY JUMPS IN THERE   IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DRAMATIC DEVICE   SO UM  
POD1000000038_S0000038 I KNEW THAT WOULD WORK   I HAD THE THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE THOSE FOREBEARS TO SAY   THIS WILL WORK   AND UM  
POD1000000038_S0000039 AND IT WAS TO GET SORT OF CREEP INTO THE STORY   WHICH WHICH IS  
POD1000000038_S0000041 IN IN SOCIETIES WHEN DICTATORS ARISE   OR WHERE HUGE CHANGES ARE MADE   AND AND WHERE SOCIETY MIGHT SWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT OR RIGHT TO LEFT   IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT   THAT'S WHY I WANTED  
POD1000000038_S0000042 WHAT ENDS UP AS LIKE A FIFTEEN YEAR SPAN ON THE SHOW   IS IS TO SHOW SHOW THESE THINGS SLOWLY CREEPING UP ON YOU   AND ACTUALLY YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH HAVING A TEA   OR OR FALLING IN LOVE  
POD1000000038_S0000043 OR OR HAVING A DIVORCE   THAT'S ACTUALLY THE STUFF   THE MEAT AND DRINK OF YOUR LIFE WHILE THE BIGGER SHADOWS ARE FALLING ON YOU UNSEEN   SO I NEEDED THAT STRETCH TO SHOW THE SMALL PICTURE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN A BIGGER PICTURE  
POD1000000038_S0000044 SO EPISODE SIX INTRODUCES A VIRUS   AND WITH THE CORONAVIRUS'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW   I WONDER IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY  
POD1000000038_S0000045 IN THE SHOW WAS THAT JUST ONE OF THE MANY SERVE THINGS GOING ON IN THE FUTURE  
POD1000000038_S0000046 IT'S INTERESTING   CAUSE CAUSE ACTUALLY IT COMES UP IN EPISODE SIX AS AS A MEANS OF ISOLATING PEOPLE WITHIN THE STORY   AH TO TO BE HONEST   UM NOW   I'M SEEING A VIRUS LIKE THIS IN ACTION  
POD1000000038_S0000047 IT IT WOULD HAVE DOMINATED EPISODE SIX TOO MUCH   IT'S AMAZING HOW IT DOMINATES AH EVERY CONVERSATION NOW   AND EPISODE SIX AS A DRAMA NOT NOT AS A DOCUMENT OF THE REAL WORLD BUT AS A DRAMA HAS STORIES TO WRAP UP  
POD1000000038_S0000049 WE NEED TO KNOW  
POD1000000038_S0000050 WHETHER LOVERS WILL BE REUNITED   WHETHER MARRIAGES WILL STAY TOGETHER   SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING NOW THAT I THOUGHT THINK THAT'S I'VE HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO VIRUSES AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN   SO I KIND OF YOU KNOW I KNEW I KNEW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ENDEMICS AND PANDEMICS  
POD1000000038_S0000051 BUT I CHOSE THE BACKGROUND IT AND UM THIS IS A SEPARATE DRAMA IN ITSELF   REALLY   MY GOODNESS   THIS IS SOME STRANGE DAYS AGAIN   JUST KEEP GETTING MADDER   WHAT DID WE USED TO TALK ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX   WHAT WHAT DID WE TALK ABOUT   CAN YOU REMEMBER   INTEREST RATES

POD1000000047_S0000000 WELCOME TO THE EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS PODCAST   THIS INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SPIEGELHALTER IS A BIT UNUSUAL AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED TWO YEARS AGO  
POD1000000047_S0000002 WE WILL CONSIDERING A STARTING PODCAST BACK THEN AND I RECORDED THIS TRIAL EPISODE WITH MY COLLEAGUE JESS WHITTLESTONE BUT ULTIMATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO ON AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT BUT I THOUGHT WHY NOT DIG IT UP AND RELEASE IT NOW  
POD1000000047_S0000004 DAVID SPIEGELHALTER IS A STATISTICIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING OF AN ACADEMIC CELEBRITY IN THE U K  
POD1000000047_S0000006 PART OF HIS ROLE IS TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK   ESPECIALLY EVERYDAY RISKS WE FACE LIKE GETTING CANCER OR DYING IN A CAR CRASH AS A RESULT   HE'S REGULARLY IN THE MEDIA   EXPLAINING THE NUMBERS IN THE NEWS  
POD1000000047_S0000007 TRYING TO ASSIST BOTH ORDINARY PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS TO FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT RISKS THAT CONFRONT US AND AVOID BEING DISTRACTED BY FLASHY RISKS THAT PERHAPS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MUCH IMPACT  
POD1000000047_S0000009 TO HELP MAKE SENSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES WE FACE IN LIFE   HE'S HAD TO INVENT CONCEPTS LIKE THE MICRO LIFE OR A THIRTY MINUTE CHANGE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY  
POD1000000047_S0000011 WE GAVE HIM A CALL BECAUSE WE WANTED TO LEARN WEATHER HE THOUGHT A LIFETIME OF WORK HAD ACTUALLY MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD   ENJOY  
POD1000000047_S0000013 HERE AT THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM   WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING WAYS TO COMPARE WHAT IT MEANS TO DO GOOD AND TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAYS OF DOING GOOD DO THE MOST GOOD   SO WE ASK QUESTION LIKE   WHICH CHARITY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO IF YOU WANT TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE  
POD1000000047_S0000014 WHAT CAREERS SHOULD YOU FOLLOW IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE WORLD AND WHICH CAUSE AREAS HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACT   THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK IT REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET CLEAR SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE  
POD1000000047_S0000016 TO HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR DAVID SPIEGELHALTER THE WILTON PROFESSOR FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY   PROFESSOR SPIEGELHALTER SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS   SCIENCE AND RISK IN ORDINARY LIFE  
POD1000000047_S0000018 HE REGULARLY APPEARS IN THE U K MEDIA AND WRITES ON HIS BLOG UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINLY   IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY DAVID  
POD1000000047_S0000019 HI  
POD1000000047_S0000021 SO WE'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT   AH WE'LL SEE HOW FAR WE GET BUT FIRST TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR POSITION  
POD1000000047_S0000022 YEAH YEAH   I'VE GOT A STRANGE JOB REALLY   I'M IN THE MATH'S DEPARTMENT AT CAMBRIDGE AND I TEACH STATISTICS TO THE UNDERGRADUATES BUT I'M ACTUALLY FUNDED BY A HEDGE FUND WINTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND AND THAT MUCH IN ORDER TO IMPROVE  
POD1000000047_S0000023 THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATICS AND RISK AND SO AH WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'VE HAD THAT JOB FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IS I SUPPOSE TO TRY TO JOIN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE  
POD1000000047_S0000024 TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WAY NUMBERS IN PARTICULAR ARE DISCUSSED IN SOCIETY  
POD1000000047_S0000026 SO   WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS DO YOU RESEARCH AND WHAT OUTREACH DO YOU DO TO HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AND UNCERTAINLY BETTER  
POD1000000047_S0000027 WELL I GET ASKED TO DO A HUGE AMOUNT OF STUFF   I SUPPOSE HELPING IN AH VARIOUS AGENCIES   COMMUNICATING RISK UM YOU KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN CANCER RISK   ABOUT THE RISK OF THE THE THE SCREENING FOR EXAMPLE   RISKS AND BENEFITS OF SCREENING   I I UM MY BACKGROUND IS IN MEDICAL STATISTICS  
POD1000000047_S0000028 SO   THAT'S WHAT I GET TO DO QUITE A LOT BUT I'VE DONE AH T V PROGRAMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE   I'VE DONE AH RADIO STUFF ABOUT UM YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THREATS TO SOCIETY FROM FUKUSHIMA AND AND SO ON  
POD1000000047_S0000029 AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH AND TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT THREATS TO TO US INDIVIDUALLY AND WHAT WOULD WHY MY HOW WE MIGHT GO TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN BETWEEN THEM SO  
POD1000000047_S0000030 UM I I M VERY INTERESTED IN RATHER THAN THE GREAT GLOBAL EXISTENTIAL RISKS SO I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE THINGS THAT AFFECT US ALL INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT HOW WE EAT OR EXERCISE AND TRANSPORT AND SO ON  
POD1000000047_S0000032 SO   YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND VERY INTERESTING IN THIS AREA IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE VERY POOR AT ESTIMATING LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES AND SO END UP  
POD1000000047_S0000033 OVERESTIMATING THE SCALE OF THE SOME PROBLEMS OF RISK THAT THEY FACE AND UNDERESTIMATING OTHERS   UM FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE   WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE MOST PRONE TO OVERESTIMATE OR UNDERESTIMATE AND GET WRONG IN VERY HARMFUL WAYS  
POD1000000047_S0000034 WELL   THE THE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AS YOU KNOW AND AND IT WAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE   I ALWAYS INCLUDE MYSELF IN THIS  
POD1000000047_S0000035 YOU KNOW I'M A SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS MY EMOTIONAL GUT REACTIONS AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE   SO   I M NOT MAKING ANY CLAIM ABOUT SOME SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND RATIONALITY COMPARED WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE  
POD1000000047_S0000036 WE JUST KNOW THAT THE WAY WE RESPOND TO THINGS AH YOU KNOW TO SIMPLIFY YOU KNOW WE CAN THINK IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN RESPOND WITH OUR GUTS OR WE CAN TRY TO ENGAGE OUR BRAIN AND THINK SLOWLY ABOUT STUFF  
POD1000000047_S0000037 AND AND THIS SO RELEVANT WHEN IT COMES TO RISK AND AH PARTICULARLY THIS IDEA THE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US IS AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC IS VERY STRONG THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000038 WHAT WE HEAR IN THE NEWS WE WE HEAR ABOUT EBOLA   WE HEAR ABOUT TERRORISM   WE HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LATEST AH THREATS THAT MIGHT AH THAT MIGHT BE IN WHAT WE NEED SOME WAY WE TRAVEL AND WE GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WELL THERE'S A PLANE CRASH OR WHATEVER  
POD1000000047_S0000039 AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE NEWS THAT'S WHAT'S IS AVAILABLE TO US SO YOU KNOW THIS WHAT SO PROMINENT BUT OF COURSE SO MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMALL INDEED THIS IS NOT A THREAT TO US PARTICULAR AT ALL  
POD1000000047_S0000040 AND AND THE THINGS THAT ARE MUCH MORE FAMILIAR   WE DON'T HEAR MUCH OF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE JUST IN HEART DISEASE CANCER ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT WE GET AND LARGELY THE AMOUNT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LACK OF EXERCISE OUR CRUMMY DIET  
POD1000000047_S0000041 AND SO ON OF COURSE IS PEOPLE GET A BIT BORED WITH THAT BECAUSE AND AND DON'T GET SO CONCERNED ABOUT IT  
POD1000000047_S0000042 DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE HAD ANY SUCCESS IMPROVING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS AND GETTING PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE STUFF THAT REALLY MATTERS  
POD1000000047_S0000043 OH I DON'T KNOW IT'S RIGHT FROM ASIA I MEAN AH IT'D BE GREAT TO THINK SO AND AH YEAH I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME GOOD PROJECTS WITH ME I'M PROUD OF FOR EXAMPLE THE REDESIGN THE CANCER SCREENING LEAFLET IN THE U K WHICH AH PRESENT THE BENEFITS AND RISKS  
POD1000000047_S0000044 CANCER SCREENING IN A IN A VERY BALANCED WAY THEY THEY AH HUGELY INNOVATES IT INNOVATE IT IS THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE GO FOR SCREENING   THEY THEY JUST SAY THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
POD1000000047_S0000045 THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE HARMS MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND AND I I BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT COMMUNICATING RISK IS NOT TO SAY OH YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT THIS IS TERRIBLE SAY WELL IF YOU DO THIS THIS MIGHT HAPPEN OR IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN  
POD1000000047_S0000046 AND WEIGH IT UP AND AND ACTUALLY YOU MAY GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR SOME INTELLIGENCE WHICH I THINK PEOPLE BASICALLY ARE   DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID BUT I'M PROUD OF IS BEING PART OF A GENERAL COMMUNITY THAT'S VERY STRONG IN BRITAIN   TO DO WITH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENCE  
POD1000000047_S0000047 AND  
POD1000000047_S0000049 WHICH I'M JUST THE SMALL PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT COVERS THE MATERIALS ON THE RADIO STUFF ON TELEVISION STUFF IN IN AH SOME NEWSPAPERS AND IN VARIOUS AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATISTICS AUTHORITY  
POD1000000047_S0000050 WHICH IS JUST TRYING TO TAKE A MUCH MORE CRITICAL ATTITUDE TO THE WAY THAT NUMBERS AND EVIDENCE ARE USED IN SOCIETY   AND I THINK IT'S IT WORKS IN IN BRITAIN WE'RE RATHER GOOD COMPARED WITH MOST PEOPLE ABOUT  
POD1000000047_S0000052 WE DON'T HAVE THESE MASSIVE FEARS OF OF VACCINATIONS OF NUCLEAR POWER OF OF EVEN G M OS AND AND SO I I I THINK THIS IS A SIGN THAT WE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE DEVELOPED QUITE A GOOD AH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE COMMUNITY  
POD1000000047_S0000054 YEAH I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA ASK YOU ABOUT UM WHAT POTENTIAL YOU THINK THERE IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR CAREER GOING INTO A CAREER PATH SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN AND TRYING TO GET INTO PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO UM  
POD1000000047_S0000055 TO HAVE A BROADER IMPACT RATHER THAN NECESSARILY JUST DOING RESEARCH AND ACADEMIA SO AH HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT IS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING AND IS IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WISH MORE ACADEMICS DID WORK ON UM  
POD1000000047_S0000056 ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I I REALLY CAME TO IT QUITE LATE AS AS A REAL PART OF MY CAREER   AS I SAID AGAIN BECAUSE A PHILANTHROPIST AND IN A HEDGE FUND AND THAT PROVIDED THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FULL TIME  
POD1000000047_S0000057 BUT I WAS DOING SOME BEFORE AS PART OF MY JOB AND I INCREASINGLY FEEL THAT ITS AH ACTUALLY A DUTY OF ACADEMICS WHO AFTER ALL   ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED FOR A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEM TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME ON PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT   IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY  
POD1000000047_S0000058 NOT EVERYBODY AT ALL   ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A WEBSITE EXPLAINING WHAT THEY DO   AND AH AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE AH ALSO SUPPORTED AND THERE SHOULD BE INCENTIVES WITHIN THE CAREER STRUCTURE FOR ACADEMICS TO DO THIS  
POD1000000047_S0000059 I'M QUITE PLEASED   IN CAMBRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE   WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PROMOTION OF PEOPLE   THEIR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED   IT IS SOMETHING I I I STRONGLY SUPPORT SO IT'S NOT EVERYBODY   BUT I THINK IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR ACADEMICS TO DO  
POD1000000047_S0000060 AND AS THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORK   IT WAS IN WHATEVER AREA   IT HAS A RELEVANCE TO SOCIETY AND IT CAN AH POTENTIALLY  
POD1000000047_S0000062 IMPROVE SOCIETY AND THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON IT  
POD1000000047_S0000063 I I PERSONALLY THINK STATISTICS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETY AND I FEEL THIS VERY STRONGLY   AND MANY STATISTICIANS DO UM IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT  
POD1000000047_S0000064 THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY HAS NOW GOT AN INITIATIVE OF TRAINING UP STATISTICS AMBASSADORS   YOUNG STATISTICIANS WHO AH WHO WANT TO DO THIS   WHO REALLY WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND COMMUNICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR WORK AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE WITH NUMBERS AND EVIDENCE  
POD1000000047_S0000065 UM I THINK THIS IS SO EXCITING SUCH FUN  
POD1000000047_S0000067 SO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WE MEET ARE THINKING OF GOING INTO ACADEMIA DO FEEL LIKE THAT'S A A GOOD PLACE TO BE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT IN THE WORLD OF COURSE THERE ARE ALSO SOME DRAWBACKS THAT YOU MIGHT AH BE AWARE OF FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN ACADEMIA  
POD1000000047_S0000068 YES YEAH I'M NOT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY YOU KNOW TO RECOMMEND YES YOU REALLY SHOULD GO INTO ACADEMIA AND YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY AND AND FRANKLY WHEN DID I STARTED IT'S QUITE YEAH   IT IS VERY TOUGH NOW  
POD1000000047_S0000069 AH AH AH IN MOST CAREERS THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE PRESSURES ON THAN THERE USED TO BE SO IT'S QUITE CAN BE QUITE A TOUGH CALL   I THINK BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF GOOD STUFF AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WORK PEOPLE I WORK WITH AND KNOW IN OTHER AREAS WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING IN  
POD1000000047_S0000070 NATURAL NATURAL UM YOU KNOW NATURAL THREATS   NATURAL DISASTERS WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN BOTANY WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING ANY AREA AND PLANT SCIENCES WHATEVER ARE A REALLY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO IMPROVE  
POD1000000047_S0000071 A LOT OF THE WORLD AND I'M I'M SO IMPRESSED BY THE DEDICATION   BUT IT IS A TOUGH JOB   AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IN THIS SORT OF PUSH TO THE OTHER PUBLISH THE WORK YOU'VE GOT TO DO ALL THIS YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE SEVENTH  
POD1000000047_S0000073 ALL THIS BUSINESS IN ORDER TO BUILD ONE'S CAREER   IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPEAR AT FIRST THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A GREAT AND GOOD IN WHAT YOU DO VERY LITTLE OF IT YOU CAN SEE A DIRECT IMPACT   HOWEVER AS I KNOW THAT I'M UM YOU KNOW WHAT'S VERY GOOD ABOUT IT IS THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000074 IT IT IS IT'S BUILDING A LOT OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT YOU CAN USE   UM I FIND THAT IN MY STATISTICAL SKILLS FOR EXAMPLE   ARE IN A MASSIVE DEMAND   AND BY ALL SORTS OF AGENCIES UM I COULD POINT IN PARTICULAR TO THE  
POD1000000047_S0000075 IMPORTANCE OF THE MILLENNIAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE UM  
POD1000000047_S0000076 WELL WHICH ARE REPLACING THEM   IN WHICH THEY SORT OF MONITORING OF THE UM STATE OF OF OF THE WELFARE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND JUST BEING ABLE TO MEASURE THINGS AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND AH  
POD1000000047_S0000077 TO DEVELOP GOOD WAYS TO DO SURVEYS   ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT WORKS AND HOW HOW YOU CAN UM IMPROVE THESE MEASURES IT IS HAS BECOME ENORMOUSLY VITAL   ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT SO I I THINK UM WELL AGAIN   I'M COMING BACK TO I THINK STATISTICS IS  
POD1000000047_S0000078 PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AREA TO GO INTO  
POD1000000047_S0000080 YEAH   ABSOLUTELY   AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY   THE KEY IDEA BEHIND EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IS THAT WE WANT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ALTRUISTIC ACTIVITIES   WHICH CHARITIES   WHICH CAREER PATHS   WHICH CAUSES DO THE MOST GOODS UM WE THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO  
POD1000000047_S0000081 MEASURE THINGS   OR AT LEAST TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE IN MAKING PROGRESS ON THOSE QUESTIONS   BUT OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER   SO A COMMON CRITICISM THAT WE OFTEN GET IS PEOPLE SAYING SOMETHING LIKE  
POD1000000047_S0000082 OH   IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CHARITIES OR CAREERS DO THE MOST GOOD SO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TOUGH TIME TRYING   AND YOU SHOULD JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT OR YOU KNOW HELP PERSONAL CAUSES   UM WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS KIND OF OBJECTION AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO IT   UM  
POD1000000047_S0000083 YOU KNOW   CONCERN ABOUT THERE BEING TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY UM YOU KNOW WE OFTEN RESPOND BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRY AND ESTIMATING THIS CLEARLY THE BEST WE HAVE   BUT YEAH WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS CHALLENGE  
POD1000000047_S0000085 I MEAN   THIS IS NOT A A COMMENT THAT'S UM JUST RESTRICTED TO AH THE AREA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT   IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME   USED TO HAPPEN IN HEALTHCARE IT IS SAID OH   YOU CAN'T PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN LIFE  
POD1000000047_S0000086 UM WE'VE JUST GO TO DO ALL WE CAN TO DO GOOD AND WE HAVE TO JUST GO WITH OUR GUTS   ESSENTIALLY   NO THAT THIS THAT VIEW NOW   CERTAINLY IN THE U K   HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DISCREDITED   YOU CAN PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN LIFE   WE DO ALL THE TIME  
POD1000000047_S0000087 I'M SURE EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000088 NOT SURE EVERYONE YOU CAN AGREE AND OF COURSE  
POD1000000047_S0000089 BUT YOU HAVE TO  
POD1000000047_S0000090 BUT NICE FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER A DECADE  
POD1000000047_S0000092 PUTTING THE VALUE ON THE MARGINAL BENEFIT OF PARTICULAR HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION AND ASSESSING WHAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED UNDER NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE ACCORDING TO REACH ALL THE CRITERIA AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT PERFECT   WE KNOW THIS DOES NOT MEASURE EVERYTHING  
POD1000000047_S0000093 BUT IT'S EXPLICIT   IT'S TRANSPARENT   AND THEY'VE DONE THEIR BEST   AND I THINK IT'S A MASSIVE SUCCESS   AND A HUGE EXAMPLE FOR OTHER COUNTRIES   HOW YOU CAN GO ABOUT IT   NOW WE KNOW IT IS A IT'S NEVER PERFECT   IT'S NEVER PERFECT  
POD1000000047_S0000094 BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE THEN TRYING TO TAKE THAT APPROACH WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL IN HEALTHCARE   AND MOVE IT INTO ALL OTHER AREAS   NOW   HOW CAN YOU DO IT SO PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO IT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT   AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE   WELL   PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE  
POD1000000047_S0000095 AND I KNOW WHAT THE VALUE OF A TREE'S WORTH   AND IT'S QUITE A LOT   BUT  
POD1000000047_S0000097 WORKING OUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT   TRYING TO MEASURE THE BENEFIT OF A OR HOW THE SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT   ET CETERA   WHAT'S THE VALUE OF A SPECIES   WHAT'S THE VALUE OF THIS  
POD1000000047_S0000098 I MEAN   I MEAN   IT SEEMS IT'S IT'S TOO EASY TO SIT BACK AND SAY   OH   YOU CAN'T DO IT   YOU CAN'T MEASURE THAT   WELL   WELL YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD GO   YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD GO   SO AS YOU SAY   IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN TRYING YOUR BEST   REALIZING YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT  
POD1000000047_S0000099 BUT NOT TO BE PUT OFF HAVING A GOOD GO   SO IT IT'S LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN STATISTICS   TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS   TRYING TO MODEL THINGS   THAT WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT WE DO IS INADEQUATE   BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T DO USEFUL THINGS  
POD1000000047_S0000101 CAN YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT NICE AND HOW THEY PRIORITIZED HEALTH TREATMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM  
POD1000000047_S0000102 YEAH   I MEAN   THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE WORKED ON   A MEDICAL STATISTICIAN   I WOULD BE IN A HUGE SUPPORT OF NICE   AND ESSENTIALLY UM WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER DECIDE TO HAVE A NEW VACCINE OR WHETHER DECIDE TO HAVE A NEW AH RECOMMEND AH  
POD1000000047_S0000103 SO FOR DRUGS TO BE PAID FOR UNDER THE N H S   FOR EXAMPLE   THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THAT OF THAT INTERVENTION   AND WHAT'S THE EXPECTED COST   AND THEN   THEY LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST TO  
POD1000000047_S0000104 AND AH PROVIDE AN EXTRA   OR THEY CALL IT QALY A QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR   SO ONE YEAR OF LIFE   IT'S DISCOUNTED IF IT'S POOR QUALITY   YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU WILL DISCOUNT IT   IT WON'T BE WORTH A WHOLE YEAR AND ESSENTIALLY THEY CAN MAKE A COMPARISON  
POD1000000047_S0000105 AND THEY LOOK   IF SOMETHING COMES IN LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF QALY   AH JUST WHEN THEY JUST PAID FOR YOU KNOW JUST   YEP   FINE   WE'LL PAY FOR IT UNDER THE N H S   IF IT'S MORE THAN ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND THEN THEY REALLY TRY  
POD1000000047_S0000107 WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THIS  
POD1000000047_S0000108 AND TRY TO GO BACK TO THE DRUG COMPANY TO RENEGOTIATE A PRICE   FOR EXAMPLE   BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND   WOW YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S MORE IN THE GRAY ZONE SO AND THIS HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY BENEFICIAL   PARTLY  
POD1000000047_S0000109 IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO DRUG COMPANIES AND GET THEM TO REDUCE THEIR PRICES   BUT UM AND ALSO TO SEE THAT SOME INTERVENTIONS   FOR EXAMPLE   CANCER SCREENING   COME IN EXTREMELY CHEAP   THEY'RE JUST WORTH DOING   IT IT ALSO MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE EXPLICIT   FOR EXAMPLE   IN HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THE FUTURE  
POD1000000047_S0000110 RATHER THAN THE PRESENT   BECAUSE THEY PUT IN A DISCOUNT RATE   CURRENTLY THREE AND A HALF PERCENT   AND NOW   THAT MEANS THAT AH AH A YEAR OF LIFE IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS TIME   FOR EXAMPLE   IS ONLY WORTH ABOUT HALF WHAT A YEAR OF LIFE NOW IS WORTH   AND AND THAT'S TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT  
POD1000000047_S0000111 AND NOW   THAT THAT OF COURSE IS CONTROVERSIAL AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BIG POLICY DECISIONS   FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE   THAT'S FAR TOO BIG A DISCOUNT RATE   WE WOULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE WORLD IN HUNDRED YEARS TIME IF WE USED THAT DISCOUNT RATE   SO IN DIFFERENT AREAS  
POD1000000047_S0000112 YOU MIGHT BE WANTING TO USE A DIFFERENT DIS DISCOUNT RATE   BUT THESE ARE TAKING ECONOMIC IDEAS AND MOVING THEM INTO VERY HUMAN DECISIONS  
POD1000000047_S0000113 AND I THINK THEY ARE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL AND ILLUMINATING   BUT THEY'RE NEVER PERFECT  
POD1000000047_S0000115 YEAH   I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN AN ARTICLE WITH AH PROFESSOR TOBY ORD ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT HEALTH   EVEN THOUGH WE SHOULD DISCOUNT FINANCIAL RETURNS   ABOUT WHY WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE IN ONE CASE AND NOT IN THE OTHER   SO WE'LL PUT UP A LINK TO THAT AH ON THE WEBSITE AH SO  
POD1000000047_S0000116 A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING OUT THEIR CAREERS   THEY FEEL JUST OVERWHELMED BY UNCERTAINTY   THEY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE GONNA EARN IN ONE CAREER OR WHAT'S THE CHANCES OF GETTING INTO ACADEMIA   OR BEING ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT  
POD1000000047_S0000117 AH HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE OUGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS AH WHEN THEY'RE JUST SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY  
POD1000000047_S0000118 WELL   I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALWAYS SURROUNDED ABOUT THIS AGAIN   THIS IS COMMON TO EVERYTHING WE DO   WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE   WHICH IS GREAT   PEOPLE DON'T DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE   PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY WANT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA GET FOR CHRISTMAS   LET ALONE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES  
POD1000000047_S0000119 AND SO UM THE THIS IS JUST A COMMON PROBLEM   AND WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH WHAT WE MIGHT CALL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY   RISK IS WHEN IT'S A VERY WELL DEFINED PROBLEM   THERE'S SHORT TERM ISSUES AND BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS   WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES ARE  
POD1000000047_S0000120 AND THEN WE CAN ALSO TAKE A RATIONAL APPROACH   WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH DEEPER UNCERTAINTY   WHEN REALLY ARE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE   OF HOW OUR LIVES MIGHT DEVELOP   THEN UM IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE A COMPLETELY FORMAL APPROACH AND SAY UM I WOULDN'T  
POD1000000047_S0000121 TRY TO SAY   OH   WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS MATHEMATICALLY AT ALL   HOWEVER   THE BASICS OF QUALITIVE IDEAS   OF THINKING THROUGH A RATIONAL DECISION ARE STILL VERY VALUABLE   BECAUSE YOU THINK OF   YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  
POD1000000047_S0000122 WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES   AND AH YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT I MIGHT DO   NOW   THAT'S ALWAYS INADEQUATE   YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE THING   AND HOWEVER   BY THINKING THROUGH THAT   SOME THINGS MIGHT COME IMMEDIATELY APPARENT   SOME IMMEDIATE RANKINGS OF  
POD1000000047_S0000123 WHAT IS PREFERABLE AND NOT PREFERABLE MIGHT BECOME APPARENT   UM AND OTHERWISE UM YOU UM UM WE MIGHT NEED TO FALL BACK AND THINK ON ON BROADER STRATEGIES FOR MAKING DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF  
POD1000000047_S0000124 WHAT WE CALL DEEPER UNCERTAINTY   NOW   THIS IS A DEEPLY CONTESTED AREA   AND WHEN GOVERNMENTS MAKE POLICIES   AH VERY OFTEN THEY'RE IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY THEY CAN'T EVEN THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN   SO THE THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION OF DEEPER UNCERTAINTY  
POD1000000047_S0000125 AND PEOPLE HAVE TESTED VARIOUS WAYS TO GO ABOUT IT   THE FIRST THING IS TO NOT TO THINK THAT YOU CAN OPTIMIZE   YOU CAN'T BE PERFECT   YOU YOU CANNOT BE PERFECT   SO THERE ARE SORT OF SUGGESTIONS OF PEOPLE MAKE IN TERMS OF GENERAL DECISION MAKING IN THESE CONTEXTS  
POD1000000047_S0000126 SO TO DO WITH FLEXIBILITY AND RESILIENCE   SO YOU WANT TO BE YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN   SO YOU BUILD IN FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTIVITY TO YOUR DECISION  
POD1000000047_S0000127 AND THAT'S THE SAME IN ANY BUSINESS   ANY GOVERNMENT   ANY ANY PROJECT AT ALL   THE OTHER THING IS BUILDING RESILIENCE IN WHICH YOU ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY CAN COPE WITH THE UNEXPECTED AND THINGS AND THAT MEANS BOTH AND YOU KNOW THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING  
POD1000000047_S0000128 AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPENING   THAT YOU ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVEN'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET   ESSENTIALLY   SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG   YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETELY GONE UP A TOTAL BLIND ALLEY THAT YOU CAN'T RENEGOTIATE  
POD1000000047_S0000129 WHICH MEANS OPERATING FROM A BASIS AH MOST ROBUST BASIS AS POSSIBLE   SO IT MEANS NOT TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THE SINGLE PATH   BUT BUILDING IN ROBUSTNESS   WHICH MEANS YEAH UM I THINK IN IN TERMS OF CAREER OF COURSE   BUILDING IN  
POD1000000047_S0000130 TRANSFERABLE SKILLS YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES   SO I THINK THESE ARE STANDARD TACTICS TO RESPOND TO DEEPER UNCERTAINTY   AND WHICH CAN BE USED IN ANY IN ANY SITUATION  
POD1000000047_S0000132 YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THE ORGANIZATION EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS TO ADVISE PEOPLE ON   YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT WITH A CAREER IS REALLY FOCUS ON IS   SPECIALLY EARLY IN YOUR CAREER LIKE KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN CHOOSE THINGS THAT ARE ROBUST UNDER YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE THINGS HAPPENING  
POD1000000047_S0000134 ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT WE FIND WE COME UP AGAINST A FAIR AMOUNT IN THINKING ABOUT CAREERS AND CHARITIES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS IS YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT CHOOSING BETWEEN A SMALL CHANCE OF SOME REALLY HUGE OUTCOME   LIKE YOU KNOW SAVING THE WORLD FROM A PANDEMIC THAT KILLS MILLIONS  
POD1000000047_S0000136 AGAINST SOME HIGH PROBABILITY OF A VERY MODERATE OR A MORE MODERATE OUTCOME SOONER   HELPING PEOPLE IN YOUR LIKE OF COMMUNITY   UM THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DEAL WITH   DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW PEOPLE CAN GO ABOUT MAKING THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS  
POD1000000047_S0000137 YEAH   VERY DIFFICULT BUT AGAIN   THESE ARE COMMON DECISIONS IN OUR IN ALWAYS IN OUR LIVES   DO WE GO FOR THE HIGH RISK OPTION OR OR THE SAFER OR THE SAFER OPTION   AND I I PERSONALLY THINK THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000138 ACTUALLY A A MIXED STRATEGY IS SOMETHING THAT BUSINESSES I THINK WOULD RECOMMEND ALTHOUGH   THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO   I'M NOT INVOLVED IN IN ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS   BUT OFTEN WHEN I THINK PEOPLE TAKE AH AN IDEA OF PORTFOLIO  
POD1000000047_S0000139 OF AH AH AH RISK TAKING   BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL RISKS   YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE WITH ANYTHING THAT YOU DO   AND THESE ARE ALL RISKS   AND SO YOU THAT MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT INVESTED IN RATHER SAFE THINGS WITH A SAFE RETURN   YOU'RE PRETTY SURE  
POD1000000047_S0000140 THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS GOING TO HAVE A REASONABLE RETURN   AND THAT YOU REALLY CAN PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE USING YOUR CAREER OR YOUR MONEY FOR   WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR AH ON THE OTHER HAND   ON MORE SPECULATIVE  
POD1000000047_S0000141 AH YOU YOU MIGHT BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT COME TO NOW COME TO ANYTHING EITHER BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IT'S PROMISING  
POD1000000047_S0000142 AND WON'T WORK OR THE THREAT WON'T ARISE IN THE FIRST PLACE   SO UM I I I THINK ACTUALLY A MIXED STRATEGY IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES   AGAIN   YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST PUT ALL THE EGGS IN ONE BASKET   SO IT'S JUST  
POD1000000047_S0000144 THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE   I ALSO PERSONALLY FEEL THAT UM THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY MY PERSONAL REACTION THAT I GIVE IS THAT UM I I QUITE LIKE A MIXED STRATEGY IN WHICH SOME OF THINGS ARE AH THE THE BIGGER  
POD1000000047_S0000146 SLIGHTLY ANONYMOUS  
POD1000000047_S0000147 TRYING TO WHERE YOU YOU'RE ALL GIVING MONEY  
POD1000000047_S0000149 LARGE ORGANIZATION IS DOING SOMETHING WHICH UM IS CONTRIBUTING IN A PRO PROBABLY FAIRLY PREDICTABLE WAY TO TO TO UM UM IMPROVING THINGS WITH PEOPLE   VERSUS YOU KNOW THE MORE PERSONAL ONES WHERE YOU DO HAVE THE PERSONAL  
POD1000000047_S0000150 CONTACT AND AND YOU MIGHT GET SLIGHTLY MORE SOME EMOTIONAL FEEDBACK FROM THEM   PARTLY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERHAPS TAKE ON A MORE AH AH THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ALTRUISM MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE ON A BIGGER AFTER ALL  
POD1000000047_S0000151 A A BIGGER COMMITMENT TO THE FUTURE  
POD1000000047_S0000153 SO THERE ARE VARIOUS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO QUANTIFY THE RISKS OF POSSIBLE GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACTIVITY   CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A MICRO MODE OR A MICRO LIFE IS  
POD1000000047_S0000154 OH YEAH   YEAH   THESE ARE UNITS THAT WELL   I INVENTED THE MICRO LIFE   SOMEONE ELSE INVENTED THE MICROMORT   IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A WAY OF TRYING TO GET A COMMON SCALE FOR YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY BECAUSE A MICROMORT IS ACUTE RISKS   THINGS THAT MIGHT KILL YOU ON THE SPOT   BUT OTHERWISE YOU'RE HEALTHY  
POD1000000047_S0000155 AND IT'S A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF DYING BECAUSE OF AN ACTION YOU MIGHT TAKE   SO SKYDIVING OR SOMETHING IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TO TEN MICROMORTS   AND AND THEN MICRO LIFE   WHICH IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHRONIC RISKS   WHICH IS THE RISK OF  
POD1000000047_S0000156 UM I THINK WE CAN START ON QUITE INTERESTING   WHICH IS AH BAD LIFESTYLE   YEAH   LACK OF EXERCISE   OR SMOKING   OR DRINKING   OR AND YEAH BAD DIET   WHATEVER   AH WHICH ISN'T GONNA KILL YOU ON THE SPOT UM BUT  
POD1000000047_S0000157 WILL AH SHORT HIS LIFE LIKELY TO SHORTEN YOUR LIFE   DEFINITELY NOT DEFINITELY AT ALL   UM MAYBE NOT   BUT PROBABLY WILL AND SO IT'S A REDUCTION OF HALF AN HOUR IN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY   I FIND THESE QUITE USEFUL   BECAUSE IT ENABLES YOU TO COMPARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT  
POD1000000047_S0000158 THINGS LIKE DIET AND SMOKING AND AH EXERCISE AND THINGS LIKE   AND AND MAKES ME FOR EXAMPLE BUT YOU KNOW SMOKING IS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST RETURN OR THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW UM IN TERMS OF NOT SMOKING   BUT THE HUGE BIGGEST RETURN   AND AH  
POD1000000047_S0000160 DRINKING AT LOW DOSES   WELL ACTUALLY   IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE  
POD1000000047_S0000162 HUGE A HUGE CONCERN   UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY SWIGGING IT DOWN   UM BUT EXERCISE   AGAIN   I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT   AND AND DIET'S IMPORTANT AND AND  
POD1000000047_S0000163 IT IT JUST GIVES YOU A FEELING OF WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHERE THE UM YOU KNOW WHERE THE PRIORITIES ARE   WHICH OF COURSE   IT'S ALL A BIT OBVIOUS   THAT THE PRIORITIES THAT PEOPLE DO IN PUBLIC HEALTH   BUT IT MAKES YOU SLIGHTLY UNCONCERNED ABOUT UM OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE REALLY CONCERNED  
POD1000000047_S0000165 SO THESE THESE CONCEPT WERE INVENTED TO HELP PEOPLE   GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS   DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD INVENT AH NEW CONCEPTS TO HELP AH PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN DO MORE GOOD IN THE WORLD  
POD1000000047_S0000167 YEAH AH AH YOU KNOW A MICROALTRUE  
POD1000000047_S0000169 IT'S DIFFICULT   I MEAN   THE QALY IS A START IS A GOOD ONE   IF YOU'RE REALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOUR AREA OF CAUSE IS IS TO DO WITH SAVING LIVES AND IMPROVING HEALTH   AND LETHAL RISK TO THE PEOPLE   THEN QALY'S IS A GOOD ONE   IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED   YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY  
POD1000000047_S0000171 SO HOW MANY YEARS OF LIFE ARE YOU GONNA GAIN FOR AND FROM YOUR INTERVENTION   AND AND AND WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GIVING MONEY FOR TO SOME PARTICULAR CHARITIES  
POD1000000047_S0000173 PROMOTE  
POD1000000047_S0000174 YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE IN THAT WAY  
POD1000000047_S0000175 IT'S MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE THE BROADER IDEA   FOR EXAMPLE   OF OF OF SUPPORTING EDUCATION   OF OF PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT   ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT   AND SO ON   QUITE HARD TO PUT A A NUMBER ON THAT UM WITHIN A WITHIN A PARTICULAR AREA CAUSE  
POD1000000047_S0000176 AH CAUSE THEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT   BUT PROVIDE HAVING METRICS THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000178 GO RIGHT ACROSS DIFFERENT AREAS  
POD1000000047_S0000180 IS IS DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CRITICIZE THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000182 ATTEMPTS TO DO  
POD1000000047_S0000183 I STILL THINK IT'S WORTH TRYING TO DO   I MEAN AND PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO DO THIS WITHIN  
POD1000000047_S0000185 WITHIN THE WITHIN ENVIRONMENT   AND SO ON   I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT ANY GREAT IDEA TO BE HONEST UM TO AH I MEAN   ONE POSSIBILITY OF COURSE IS  
POD1000000047_S0000186 IS LOOKING AT WITH GENERAL MEASURES OF WELL BEING   WHICH AGAIN   PEOPLE ARE DOING   IT'S MEASURED BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS NOW TO TRY TO MEASURE WELL BEING   UM IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE ABOUT THEY'RE LIVES AND AND  
POD1000000047_S0000187 SO GENERAL WELL BEING INDICES WHICH ARE NOT JUST I MEAN YOU KNOW HEALTH RELATED   OR LENGTH OF LIFE RELATED   AND I THINK AH HAVE GOT HAVE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL   BUT IT'S NOT GONNA RIGHT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THE PERFECT MEASURE ON THEM  
POD1000000047_S0000188 SO PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ASKED   YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU RATE AH HOW GOOD YOUR LIFE IS GOING FROM AH ONE TO TEN   YOU KNOW TYPICALLY THEY GIVE ANSWERS BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT AT LEAST IN THE U K  
POD1000000047_S0000189 MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A MICRO HAPPY WHICH SHOULD BE SOMETHING AS GOOD AS MOVING SOMEONE FROM SIX TO SEVEN OR SEVEN TO EIGHT ON THIS WELFARE SCALE  
POD1000000047_S0000190 YEAH YEAH YEAH NO I'M YES YEAH YEAH EXACTLY AH AH AH I THINK THAT NO THE SCALES UM WELL ACTUALLY I FIND THEM VERY REVEALING WHEN PEOPLE DO MEASURE THEM   PARTICULAR CROSS CULTURE AS YOU SAID  
POD1000000047_S0000192 EVERYONE SAYS SEVEN  
POD1000000047_S0000194 MAYBE CAUSE I LIKE NUMBER SEVEN BUT IT ALSO REFLEXES THIS IDEA   WHY IT'S NOT BAD AH YOU KNOW  
POD1000000047_S0000195 MUSTN'T GRUMBLE  
POD1000000047_S0000197 YOU KNOW COULD BE BETTER   BUT MUSTN'T GRUMBLE YOU KNOW SO SLIGHTLY BRITISH   STOIC ATTITUDE SO UM I THINK IT'S ALMOST PREDICTABLE WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA RESPOND   BUT I FIND   FOR EXAMPLE   THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESPONSES AND HOW THE AGE DISTRIBUTION VARIES ACROSS CULTURES  
POD1000000047_S0000198 EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND UM THE IDEA OF UM YOU KNOW WHETHER ONE COULD MOVE  
POD1000000047_S0000200 YOU KNOW AH GROUPS OF PEOPLE AH ON THAT SCALE AND WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT   AND WHEN I THINK OF LITTLE CHARITIES   AND SOME OF THE ONES I I I GIVE TO THE YOU KNOW  
POD1000000047_S0000201 WHICH ARE ARE NOT DIRECTLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER BUT UM YOU'D HOPE TO WOULD IMPROVE PEOPLE'S WELL BEING AND SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND CONSIDERABLY  
POD1000000047_S0000202 YEAH   IT IS A FASCINATING AREA OF A RESEARCH   AND AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES   SO I THINK IN THE U K AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA   PEOPLE DO TEND TO GIVE SEVEN OR MAYBE EIGHT IF THEY'RE FEELING PARTICULARLY GOOD   BUT IN SOUTH AMERICA   PEOPLE ARE JUST FOR SOME REASON   MORE EXUBERANT  
POD1000000047_S0000203 AND AH TEND TO OFTEN GIVE EIGHTS AH   EVEN EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RELATIVELY POOR   AH BUT BY CONTRAST   IN AH EASTERN EUROPE AND EASTERN ASIA   LIKE JAPAN AND CHINA   PEOPLE TEND TO GIVE RELATIVELY LOW SCORES RELATIVE TO HOW LIFE THEY WELL SEEMS TO   SEEMS TO BE GOING FROM THE OUTSIDE  
POD1000000047_S0000204 YEAH   YEAH YEAH NO   NO   PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT CULTURES   I THINK IN AFRICA THEY'RE EVEN LOWER PEOPLE ARE VERY  
POD1000000047_S0000206 YEAH   THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES THAT WHERE THE AVERAGE IS AS LOW AS FOUR OUT OF TEN   WHICH MAY MAYBE HALF OF PEOPLE ARE GIVING LESS THAN FOUR WHICH IS AH A BIT UNFORTUNATE  
POD1000000047_S0000207 FOR THE GAIN   I MEAN   THESE ARE I THEY ARE THEY'RE VERY CULTURALLY   AND I THINK SPECIFIC AND SO AND BUT I THINK WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS RELATIVE CHANGES RELATIVE CHANGES PERHAPS YOU KNOW COMPARED WITH  
POD1000000047_S0000208 THE AVERAGE IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT ONE WOULD FOR YOU AND UM YOU CAN'T JUST GET EVERYONE UP TO EIGHT OR WHATEVER   I MEAN   THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT CULTURAL ATTITUDES TO DO WITH   I THINK   THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THOSE QUESTIONS  
POD1000000047_S0000209 YEAH SO BY TRYING TO ESTIMATE RISKS OR THE SIZE OF PROBLEMS IN THIS QUANTITATIVE WAY   DO YOU THINK WE RISK BEING BIASED AGAINST APPROACHES THAT ARE HARDER TO QUANTIFY  
POD1000000047_S0000210 YEAH   I THINK IT ALWAYS IS A PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE START BELIEVING YOU KNOW THAT THE MODEL   THE MEASURE   WHICH IS A ONLY A VERY INADEQUATE THING   STARTS TRYING TO STARTS BECOMING THE THING THAT YOU ARE IN FACT THEN TRYING TO   UM YOU KNOW YOU'RE FOCUSED ON  
POD1000000047_S0000211 TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALL OTHERS   YOU MEAN AND AND THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH OVER YOU KNOW METRICIZING AN ANY ACTIVITY   YOU KNOW PRETENDING THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE BENEFITS OF EVERYTHING  
POD1000000047_S0000213 ACADEMIC WORLD   OF COURSE IS A AND  
POD1000000047_S0000214 REAL EXAMPLE OF THAT WHERE PEOPLE START GETTING OBSESSED WITH IMPACT FACTORS AND NONSENSE LIKE THAT   SO AND THERE'S A AH AH REAL DANGER WITH WITH UM BELIEVING THESE THINGS TOO MUCH   AND ALSO IN TIME  
POD1000000047_S0000215 I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DAMN GOOD GO AT TRYING TO DO IT   AND JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS IS DIFFICULT AND CANNOT BE DONE PERFECTLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T AT LEAST HAVE A HAVE A STAB AT IT   BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU MAY  
POD1000000047_S0000217 YOU KNOW OFTEN  
POD1000000047_S0000218 THESE THINGS MIGHT CAN GET REALLY CLEAR AROUND THINGS   YOU KNOW THE GREAT PRECISION MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT AN NOT AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE SOURCES COMPARED WITH INCIDENCES  
POD1000000047_S0000220 YEAH AND I THINK THAT RATHER THAN GIVING US A PERFECT ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS USING YOU KNOW MODELS AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT FACTORS   CAN AS YOU SAY JUST HELP YOU TO IDENTIFY LIKE CLEAR DIFFERENCES OR AREAS WHERE YOU NEED TO GET MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FACTOR THAT IN ALL  
POD1000000047_S0000221 SO I MUST SAY IT CAN DEFINITELY BE VERY USEFUL UM FINALLY   JUST TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN BENEFIT FROM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS   LEARNING MORE STATISTICS   YOU KNOW EITHER IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES   OR IN BEING MORE EFFECTIVE AS ALTRUISTS  
POD1000000047_S0000222 UM AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK   I GUESS   RELATING BACK TO THE PAST QUESTION   IT COULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT US  
POD1000000047_S0000224 YEAH   I THINK I THINK UM YEAH OF COURSE I DO OF COURSE I'D SAY THIS   WOULDN'T I   UM BUT YEAH   I DO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEM A GREATER IDEA OF STATS AND MEASUREMENT   AND NUMBER   AND QUANTITY  
POD1000000047_S0000225 AND AND THE FRAILTIES OF THAT AS WELL   BECAUSE THE POINT ABOUT UNDERSTANDING STATISTICS IS BOTH UNDERSTANDING THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR WEAKNESSES   THE TWO ARE ABSOLUTELY HAND IN HAND   AND WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO DO AT THE MOMENT   THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE NOT CONFIDENT  
POD1000000047_S0000226 WITH WITH WITH NUMBERS AND HOW THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED   BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THEIR WHOLE   ARE ALWAYS CONSTRUCTED   SOMEONE HAS CHOSEN WHAT TO MEASURE   AND THE THERE IS THEY TEND TO EITHER ACCEPT THEM AS IF THEY'RE GOD GIVEN TRUTH AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE NUMBER AND THAT'S SO VITAL  
POD1000000047_S0000227 FOR YOU AND THAT IS IT   THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR   OR REJECT THEM OUT OF HAND   OH   YOU CAN'T PUT NUMBERS  
POD1000000047_S0000229 DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS AND   THIS IS NONSENSE   AND THOSE TWO EXTREME VIEWS BOTH EQUALLY IDIOTIC  
POD1000000047_S0000231 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED VIEW   YOU'LL REALIZE THAT STATISTICS   NUMBERS   AND MEASUREMENT ARE AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TOOL   BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST A TOOL   AND THEY THEY HAVE THEIR FRAILTIES AND INADEQUACIES   SO AH THEY BOTH NEED TO BE  
POD1000000047_S0000233 TEACH AND UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTH AND THE LIMITATIONS   AND WHAT I MEAN I'M INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO DO JUST THAT  
POD1000000047_S0000235 SO IT'S AH REALLY A MATTER OF TRYING TO AH ASSIGN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT TO EACH DIFFERENT KIND OF EVIDENCE OR EACH DIFFERENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT COMES YOUR WAY  
POD1000000047_S0000236 I THINK I MEAN IN THE END   WHAT STATISTICS IS IS TO DO WITH ITS QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT THAT THE TALKING ABOUT AND AND EVIDENCE CAN BE GOOD OR BAD OR YOU KNOW A LONG WHOLE SCALE IT'S NOT A TRUE OR FALSE  
POD1000000047_S0000237 UM IT'S JUST EVIDENCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO WEIGH UP OUR EVIDENCE AND WHICH WE DO ALL THE TIME IN OUR LIVES WE DO THIS BUT YOU KNOW OUR GUTS TEND TO BE AH BIT FALLIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WEIGHING UP EVIDENCE  
POD1000000047_S0000239 TOO INFLUENCED BY CERTAIN SALIENT THINGS THAT WOULD ATTRACT OUR ATTENTION   AND SO AS SHE'S STANDING BACK AND TRYING TO BE A BIT COOLER ABOUT WEIGHING UP EVIDENCE   I THINK IT'S A REALLY VALUABLE AH THING TO TRY TO DO IN ALL AREAS OF LIFE   IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT  
POD1000000047_S0000240 YEAH ABSOLUTELY   WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD COMPLETELY DISCOUNT THAT GUT FEELING BUT OFTEN JUST SUPPLEMENT IT WITH SOME EXTRA EVIDENCE SOURCE STATISTICS  
POD1000000047_S0000241 LIKE MY GUTS  
POD1000000047_S0000243 I I DON'T TRUST THEM A BIT   BUT I STILL YOU KNOW GO WITH THEM  
POD1000000047_S0000244 YEAH   I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR NOW   BUT THANKS SO MUCH   DAVID UM THIS HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE UM REALLY INTERESTING  
POD1000000047_S0000245 OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH

POD1000000048_S0000003 MILES'S RESEARCH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION   THE BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER   AND THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE   THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO TALK TO US TODAY   MILES  
POD1000000048_S0000004 THANKS FOR HAVING ME  
POD1000000048_S0000005 SO FIRST UP   MAYBE JUST TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT QUESTIONS YOU'RE LOOKING INTO AT THE MOMENT  
POD1000000048_S0000007 SURE   AH SO I USED TO WORK ON ENERGY POLICY AH WHEN I WAS LIVING IN WASHINGTON D C   AND I'VE GRADUALLY MOVED INTO A I POLICY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS   BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS MORE OF A NEGLECTED AREA AND COULD HAVE A VERY LARGE IMPACT  
POD1000000048_S0000008 AH SO I RECENTLY STARTED AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND I'M ALSO CONCURRENTLY FINISHING UP MY P H D IN HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY  
POD1000000048_S0000009 AH SO IN BOTH CAPACITIES   I AM AH INTERESTED IN WHAT SORTS OF METHODS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THINKING ABOUT A I IN A RIGOROUS WAY   AND PARTICULARLY THE UNCERTAINTY OF POSSIBLE FUTURES SURROUNDING A I  
POD1000000048_S0000010 AH AND I HAVE A FEW MORE SPECIFIC INTERESTS SUCH AS OPENNESS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE RISKS RELATED TO BAD ACTORS  
POD1000000048_S0000011 OKAY UM SO ARE YOU TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND WHEN AND WHAT SORT OF EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE  
POD1000000048_S0000012 AH SO NOT NECESSARILY PREDICT PER SE   BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT'S PLAUSIBLE   I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH ANY AH HIGH CONFIDENCE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND WHEN  
POD1000000048_S0000013 BUT UNDERSTANDING   FOR EXAMPLE   WHAT SORTS OF AH ACTIONS PEOPLE COULD CARRY OUT WITH A I SYSTEMS TODAY OR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS LIKE CYBER SECURITY AH AH  
POD1000000048_S0000014 AND INFORMATION OPERATIONS AH   THE PRODUCTION OF FAKE NEWS AUTOMATICALLY AND AUTONOMOUS DRONES AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000015 I THINK UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY LANDSCAPE OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE A VERY DETAILED FORECAST OF WHEN EXACTLY AH SOMETHING WILL OCCUR SO MUCH AS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE AH GIVEN NEAR TERM TRENDS  
POD1000000048_S0000017 AH YEAH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY THIS IS WHEN THE AH THIS PARTICULAR ACCIDENT OR MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR WILL OCCUR   BUT JUST AH THAT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF RISKS THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR  
POD1000000048_S0000018 RIGHT RIGHT DOES THAT BRING YOU INTO CONTACT WITH AH WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPING A I'S LIKE LIKE GOOGLE  
POD1000000048_S0000020 YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY   SO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AN INTEREST IN AH MAKING SURE THAT A I IS AH AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE  
POD1000000048_S0000022 KEENLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BE MISUSED AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE AH ACCIDENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM  
POD1000000048_S0000023 SO FOR EXAMPLE   I HELD A WORKSHOP AH FAIRLY RECENTLY ON THE AH CONNECTION BETWEEN BAD ACTORS AND A I AND AH WHAT SORTS OF BAD ACTORS WE MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS SPACE   AND WE HAD SOME PARTICIPATION FROM SOME OF THOSE GROUPS  
POD1000000048_S0000024 RIGHT RIGHT WHAT KINDS OF BAD ACTORS ARE YOU THINKING OF  
POD1000000048_S0000025 AH I THINK THERE AH YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES   SO DEPENDING ON THE DOMAIN THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN   AH YOU MIGHT END UP WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF ACTORS  
POD1000000048_S0000026 SO IN THE CASE OF AH PHYSICAL HARM ASSOCIATED WITH A I   YOU MIGHT LOOK AT AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AH AND THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES   AND IN THAT CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY APPEALING TO STATE ACTORS AS WELL AS TERRORISTS  
POD1000000048_S0000027 WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES   THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH AUTONOMY IF ANY   IN THE CASE OF ISIS OVERSEAS  
POD1000000048_S0000028 SO AH THERE ARE CASES LIKE THAT WHERE WE CAN FORESEE THAT PARTICULAR AH GROUPS WHEN GIVEN MORE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS AH HIGHER BASELINE LEVELS OF AUTONOMY IN CONSUMER DRONES  
POD1000000048_S0000029 AH WOULD LIKE AH WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO AND WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OUT AH DAMAGE ON A LARGER SCALE  
POD1000000048_S0000030 AH BUT IN OTHER CASES   IT'S LESS CLEAR   FOR EXAMPLE   AH THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND MASS SURVEILLANCE   AND IT'S OFTEN NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER ONE SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT AH STATES OR CORPORATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000031 AH DEPENDING ON WHAT SORTS OF RISK YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT   FOR EXAMPLE   UM CORPORATIONS AH CURRENTLY HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON PEOPLE AND  
POD1000000048_S0000032 THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT AH THE USE OF A I TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT HAVE CRITICAL IMPACTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES  
POD1000000048_S0000033 SUCH AS DENYING LOANS AH AND AH IN COURT DECISIONS AND SO FORTH AH THAT ARE BEING INFORMED BY OFTEN NOT VERY TRANSPARENT ALGORITHMS  
POD1000000048_S0000034 SO THOSE THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS   BUT THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT CLASS OF CONCERNS AROUND AH AH AUTHORITARIAN STATES USING A I FOR AH OPPRESSION  
POD1000000048_S0000035 SO IT'S AH I THINK THERE'S A RANGE OF RISKS   BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING AH THERE'S GOING TO BE A STUDY INCREASE IN THE FLOOR OF THE SKILL LEVEL AS THESE AH A I TECHNOLOGIES DIFFUSE  
POD1000000048_S0000036 THAT IS   THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE AH CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE   THAT IS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WITH MORE ACCESS TO COMPUTING POWER   AH MONEY   AND DATA AT THE HIGHER END  
POD1000000048_S0000037 SO AH IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU MIGHT EXPECT THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000038 AH THE THE BIGGEST ACTORS ARE THE MOST CONCERNING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST AH SKILL AND AH RESOURCES   BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALSO ARE SOMETIMES   IN THE CASE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS  
POD1000000048_S0000039 AH HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO CITIZENS   AND IN THE CASE OF CORPORATIONS HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS   YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL AH ROGUE ACTORS  
POD1000000048_S0000040 SO AH AH THAT'S AN ISSUE I'M STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REPORT THAT I'M WRITING BASED ON THAT WORKSHOP  
POD1000000048_S0000041 RIGHT SINCE PEOPLE OFTEN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AH THE SHORT TERM AH RISKS FROM A I   LIKE SELF DRIVING CARS NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ALGORITHMIC BIAS  
POD1000000048_S0000042 AND THEN THE LONGER TERM CONCERNS OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ONCE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AH AS SMART AS HUMANS OR POTENTIALLY AH MUCH   MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT   WHICH ONE OF THOSE DO YOU SPEND MORE TIME WORKING ON  
POD1000000048_S0000043 I TRY TO FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT AH SPAN DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS   SO I THINK THAT A I AND SECURITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME EARLY INSTANCES OF TODAY  
POD1000000048_S0000044 SO IT'S ALREADY BEING USED FOR DETECTION OF AH CYBER THREATS   FOR EXAMPLE   AND THE PRODUCTION OF VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE   THERE'S A LOT OF AH RESEARCH GOING ON  
POD1000000048_S0000045 WHICH AN EXAMPLE BEING THE DARPA GRANT CYBER AH CYBER GRANT CHALLENGE RECENTLY   WHERE THERE'S AUTOMATED HACKING AH AND AUTOMATED DEFENSE  
POD1000000048_S0000046 AH SO THERE'S ALREADY STUFF HAPPENING ON THE FRONT OF A I AND SECURITY AS WELL AS THE ECONOMICS OF A I AND SO AND AH ISSUES SURROUNDING PRIVACY  
POD1000000048_S0000047 BUT AH IT'S IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER THE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE WILL JUST BE AH STRAIGHTFORWARD EXTENSIONS OF THOSE OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT  
POD1000000048_S0000049 THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AH AND IMAGINE HOW IT MIGHT PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP INTO A MORE EXTREME FUTURE   AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES WHEN A I AH PROGRESSES MORE QUICKLY  
POD1000000048_S0000050 RIGHT RIGHT SO I SHOULD SAY THIS POINT UM   THAT AH WE HAVE A PROFILE UP ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT THE UM THE THE POTENTIAL UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE   SO WE GO THROUGH AH ALL ALL OF THE BASICS  
POD1000000048_S0000051 AND MILES   YOU HAVE A FORTHCOMING GUIDE TO AH WORK ON A I POLICY AND STRATEGY THAT AH WE'RE GONNA LINK TO   SO HERE   WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT   IF YOU FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED   THEN POTENTIALLY JUST GO ON TO READ ONE OF THOSE UM ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FIRST  
POD1000000048_S0000052 UM SO OH WHICH POLICY OR STRATEGY QUESTIONS DO YOU SEE AS MOST IMPORTANT FOR US TO ANSWER IN ORDER TO ENSURE UM THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOES WELL RATHER THAN IN A IN A BAD WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000053 I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS   AND SOME OF THE ONES SAY WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER SURROUNDING SECURITY AND AND PREVENTING THE UM WEAPONIZATION OF A I BY AH DANGEROUS ACTORS IS ONE  
POD1000000048_S0000054 BUT ONE AH AND ALSO OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA AND BY ACADEMICS   SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALGORITHMS   TRANSPARENCY   AH THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF A I AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000055 AH BUT ONE THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT   PARTICULARLY OVER THE LONG AH OVER THE LONG TERM   AH THIS IS A CASE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A NEED TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES  
POD1000000048_S0000056 IS COORDINATION SURROUNDING A I SAFETY   SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION CALLED TO A I SAFETY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AH AND THERE'S STARTING TO BE A LOT OF AH CONCRETE AND SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM OF AVOIDING CERTAIN A I SAFETY FAILURE MODES  
POD1000000048_S0000057 LIKE WIRE HEADING AND VALUE MISALIGNMENT AND SO FORTH   AH BUT THERE'S BEEN LESS ATTENTION PAID TO HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY AH INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO ACT ON THE THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE GOOD THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE DEVELOPED  
POD1000000048_S0000058 ASSUMING THAT THEY WILL BE DEVELOPED   AND THAT'S A A POTENTIALLY BIG PROBLEM IF THERE'S A COMPETITIVE SITUATION BETWEEN COMPANIES OR BETWEEN COUNTRIES OR BOTH AND THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP ON THOSE SAFETY MEASURES  
POD1000000048_S0000059 SO THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK   FOR EXAMPLE   AH BY ARMSTRONG ET AL AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AH LOOKING AT AH ARMS RACE TYPE SCENARIOS INVOLVING A I WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP  
POD1000000048_S0000060 BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THE LEAD AH IN AN A I RACE   AND THERE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT AH WE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EXTENT WILL BE  
POD1000000048_S0000061 BUT THERE IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF A I SYSTEMS   SO AH ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO   IN ORDER TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE WHETHER ECONOMIC OR MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE WISE AH  
POD1000000048_S0000062 RAMP UP THE CAPABILITIES OF AN A I SYSTEM BY ADDING MORE HARDWARE   ADDING MORE DATA   ADDING MORE SENSORS AND EFFECTORS AND SO FORTH   UM BUT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THE FULL AH BEHAVIORAL ENVELOPE OF THE SYSTEM  
POD1000000048_S0000063 SO TO SPEAK   AND HOW TO CONSTRAIN ACTORS THE HUMAN ACTORS FROM DOING THAT AH IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM  
POD1000000048_S0000064 SO I'VE   AH I ALONG WITH OTHERS AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND OTHER DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE STARTED THINKING ABOUT AH WHAT IS AN INCENTIVE COMPATIBLE MECHANISM TO ENSURE  
POD1000000048_S0000065 AH THE PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING IN THAT CASE   THAT IS TO SAY   WE DON'T WANT TO ASK PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS  
POD1000000048_S0000066 IF THEY ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING THESE SYSTEMS AND PROTECTING THEMSELVES   MILITARILY OR OTHERWISE   AH BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE CONSTRAINED IN SOME SORT OF WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000067 SO ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE   AH AT A RANGE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY FOR A FULLY FLESHED OUT EXAMPLE   BUT JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE SORT OF THING I'M TALKING ABOUT  
POD1000000048_S0000068 WOULD BE SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN A I DEVELOPERS SUCH THAT AH IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LATEST BREAKTHROUGHS OR THE LATEST COMPUTING POWER  
POD1000000048_S0000069 AH YOU WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT TO SOME SORT OF AH SAFETY MONITORING AND AND AH ADHERE TO CERTAIN BEST PRACTICES  
POD1000000048_S0000070 AH THAT WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE IF YOU WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE TO AH TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE AH SAFETY PROTOCOLS   SO AH THAT'S AGAIN   THAT'S NOT A FULLY WORKED OUT EXAMPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000071 THAT'S THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLASS OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE   DEVELOPING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT THING AH THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED ON THE TECHNICAL FRONT ACTUALLY GETS IMPLEMENTED  
POD1000000048_S0000072 RIGHT AH DO YOU LOOK MUCH AT   SAY   WHAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE DOING IN THIS AREA   WHETHER THERE'S REGULATIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING IN PLACE OR AT LEAST PREPARING TO PUT IN PLACE IN FUTURE  
POD1000000048_S0000073 YEAH   SO I THINK THAT THAT TIES IN WITH WHAT I WAS SAYING A LITTLE BIT   IN THAT ONE MIGHT ENVISION THAT AH AS A I CAPABILITIES DEVELOP  
POD1000000048_S0000074 IT'LL BE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS AH A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT A COUNTRY BE ON THE THE LEADING EDGE   I THINK IT'S A IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT YET AH  
POD1000000048_S0000075 I THINK THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT   CLEARLY   IN MY OPINION   IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR COUNTRIES TO HAVE SOME EXPERTS IN HOUSE IN THEIR GOVERNMENTS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT A I  
POD1000000048_S0000076 AND ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CRISES AS THEY ARISE   IF THEY ARISE   AH AND TO BE ABLE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF AH AH A I ON THE LABOR FORCE   FOR EXAMPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000077 AH SO I THINK THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT AND SOME POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR DEALING WITH SOME OF THE NEAR TERM ISSUES   BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM ISSUES  
POD1000000048_S0000078 IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO RUSH INTO A SITUATION WHERE GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE LEADING THIS   IF IF THAT WOULD TURN OUT TO AH ONLY ACCENTUATE THE THE ARMS RACE DYNAMICS  
POD1000000048_S0000079 WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO AVOID AH IF A I IS SEEN EVEN MORE AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE IN AN UNHARMED UNHELPFUL WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000080 SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THOSE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM POLICY ISSUES AROUND A I TO DEVELOP A MORE POSITIVE PROPOSAL THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST  
POD1000000048_S0000081 AH YOU KNOW THE U S GOVERNMENT GETTING INVOLVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACCELERATING AH AMERICAN A I CAPABILITIES  
POD1000000048_S0000082 BUT SOME MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH  
POD1000000048_S0000083 YEAH I SUPPOSE WITH WITH PREVIOUS DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES LIKE LIKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS   THERE'S THERE'S BEEN AGREEMENTS TO TRY TO UM SLOW DOWN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND AND DEPLOYMENT   IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN HERE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL  
POD1000000048_S0000085 I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF SLOWING DOWN AMONG A SMALL NUMBER OF ACTORS  
POD1000000048_S0000086 AWE'RE FORTUNATE THAT THERE IS A AH HIGH CONCENTRATION OF AH COMPUTING POWER AND TALENT AND SKILL IN A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000087 SO THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO CHANCE OF SOME RANDOM PERSON AH OUT COMPETING AH YOU KNOW THE TOP ORGANIZATIONS IN A I AH IN A SURPRISING WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000088 AH SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WITH WITH SOME OF THE TOP COMPANIES AND NONPROFITS AS WELL AH COUNTRIES   THEY COULD COORDINATE IN SOME SORT OF WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000089 AH NOT TO POSTPONE A I YOU KNOW ACROSS SOCIETY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME   BUT AT LEAST TO BE CAUTIOUS AH IN THE LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND TO ALLOW TIME FOR AH MUTUAL VETTING OF OF SAFETY PROCEDURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000090 SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF COORDINATION   BUT AH THE THE TECHNICAL AND THE POLITICAL FACTORS INTERACT TO A LARGE EXTENT  
POD1000000048_S0000091 BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE EFFICIENT AND THAT DON'T INTRODUCE A LOT OF OVERHEAD   AH COMPUTATIONAL OR OTHERWISE   AH INTO THESE SYSTEMS  
POD1000000048_S0000092 THEN WE'LL BE IN A BETTER PLACE TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO COORDINATE BECAUSE IT WON'T BE IMPOSING A LOT OF COSTS ON THEM   AND LIKEWISE   TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COORDINATE BETTER  
POD1000000048_S0000093 IT WILL AH WE'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AH THIS AH MECHANISMS IF THEY DO IMPOSE SOME PERFORMANCE PENALTIES  
POD1000000048_S0000094 RIGHT SO SO CAN YOU THINK OF UM AH LIKE ANY MAJOR BITS OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON A I STRATEGY QUESTIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS  
POD1000000048_S0000095 SO THE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED OF AH THE PAPER BY ARMSTRONG ET AL AH CALLED RACING TO THE PRECIPICE IS ONE EXAMPLE   AND IT PRESENTED SORT OF A STARK VERSION OF THE ARMS RACE SCENARIO  
POD1000000048_S0000096 THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE REASONS TO BE OUR MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN AH THAN ARE PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER AH BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT ONLY A CERTAIN AH IN A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS   AS WITH ANY AH MODEL  
POD1000000048_S0000097 BUT AH MORE GENERALLY   I THINK THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR GOOD POLICIES IN RECENT YEARS   SO FOR EXAMPLE   WITH THE ASILOMAR AH CONFERENCE AND THE SET OF ASILOMAR A I PRINCIPLES  
POD1000000048_S0000098 SO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD STEP TOWARDS DEVELOPING SOME SHARED UNDERSTANDING AROUND AH THE NEED TO AVOID ARMS RACES AND AH CONCERNS OVER A I WEAPONIZATION AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000099 UM BUT AH IT'S I I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR  
POD1000000048_S0000100 AH PROGRESS TO BE MADE   SO AH THERE WAS A PAPER PUT OUT BY THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AH BY NICK BOSTROM   CARRICK FLYNN   AND AH ALLAN DEFOE RECENTLY THAT AH LOOKS AT POLICY DESIDERATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE SUPERINTELLIGENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000101 AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD MATERIAL THERE   BUT I THINK AH THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT AH WE'RE STILL AT THE THE THE HIGH LEVEL PRINCIPLES STAGE OF DEVELOPING THESE POLICIES  
POD1000000048_S0000102 SO WE WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID THAN AH THAN WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO   AND WHAT SORT OF WHAT WHAT A AH GOOD POLICY PROPOSAL WOULD LOOK LIKE  
POD1000000048_S0000103 BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE ANYTHING AH SUPER ACTIONABLE   SO I THINK THE SITUATION IS A BIT ANALOGOUS TO WHERE A I SAFETY WAS A FEW YEARS AGO  
POD1000000048_S0000104 WHERE THERE WERE AH THERE WAS STARTING TO BE AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AH WITH AH THE BOOK SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER PUBLICATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000105 AND PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO TAKE THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY AND STARTED TO HAVE A VOCABULARY FOR WHAT A WHAT A SOLUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH AH VALUE ALIGNMENT AH AND OTHER TERMS BEING COINED  
POD1000000048_S0000106 AH BUT THERE WASN'T YET ANY YOU KNOW CONCRETE AH RESEARCH AGENDA   AND YEAH SUBSEQUENTLY   THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF AH CONCRETE RESEARCH AGENDAS  
POD1000000048_S0000107 AS WELL AS TECHNICAL PROGRESS ON SOME PARTS OF THOSE RESEARCH AGENDAS AH WITH WORK BY OPENAI AND DEEPMIND AND OTHERS AH LEADING THE WAY  
POD1000000048_S0000108 SO I THINK THAT WE'RE POTENTIALLY IN A SIMILARLY EXCITING PHASE ON THE A I POLICY FRONT WHERE WE HAVE A A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS   AH AND WITH THE EXAMPLE OF AVOIDING ARMS RACES AH BEING YOU KNOW FOREFRONT IN MY MIND  
POD1000000048_S0000109 AT LEAST   BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE A CONCRETE AH WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW CLEAR MODELS AND AH CASE STUDIES THAT WE CAN POINT TO AS AS WAYS FORWARD  
POD1000000048_S0000110 SO I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT STEP   IS MOVING INTO MORE CONCRETE PROPOSALS AND AH TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN RECENT PAPERS  
POD1000000048_S0000112 SO IT SEEMS LIKE EXCUSE ME SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE LATEST THINKING IN THIS AREA UM ISN'T WRITTEN UP IN PUBLIC YET   PARTLY BECAUSE AH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUBLICIZE THEIR VIEWS AT THIS POINT OR JUST BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET PAPERS PUBLISHED  
POD1000000048_S0000113 AH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THE AREA TO GET UP TO SPEED ON THE ISSUES  
POD1000000048_S0000114 SO I THINK   UM AGAIN   IT'S SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE SITUATION WITH UM AH YOU KNOW A I SAFETY A FEW YEARS AGO   AND I THINK THE BOOK SUPERINTELLIGENCE WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF HAVING A SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO  
POD1000000048_S0000115 BUT AH IT'S LESS CLEAR IF THERE'S ONE SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO ON AH A I POLICY ISSUES   THOUGH I'M HOPING HOPING THAT THE CAREER GUIDE THAT I'M WORKING ON WILL BE SOMEWHAT USEFUL IN THAT REGARD  
POD1000000048_S0000116 ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT COMES TO MIND IS A SYLLABUS FOR A CLASS ON THE GLOBAL POLITICS OF A I DEVELOPED BY AH ALLAN DAFOE AT YIELD AND THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE  
POD1000000048_S0000117 THAT THAT'S A VERY DETAILED UM LIST OF RESOURCES   AH AND I I AH I'M SURE THERE'LL BE A LINK PROVIDED AH FOR FOR AH THIS INTERVIEW SOMEWHERE AH  
POD1000000048_S0000118 YEAH  
POD1000000048_S0000119 AND YEAH SO I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER SET OF RESOURCES   IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LONG LIST OF UM AH YOU KNOW BOTH FORMAL AH YOU KNOW ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS THINGS IN THE MORE GRAY LITERATURE  
POD1000000048_S0000120 AH SUCH AS BLOG POSTS   WHICH AH IS   YOU KNOW I THINK   THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOU KNOW AS THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY WRITTEN UP ACADEMICALLY   BUT ARE YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE   BUT EVEN THERE   THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS LIKE AH YOU KNOW GOOGLE DOCS THAT ARE USED INTERNALLY AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000121 SO I THINK IF IF BASED ON READING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS   THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN   THEN AH THE OBVIOUS NEXT STEP IS JUST TO GET IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE AH WHO ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND AND ASK AND YOU KNOW INDICATE WHAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE  
POD1000000048_S0000122 AND THERE MIGHT BE AH THINGS THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE ONLINE THAT THEY CAN POINT YOU TO  
POD1000000048_S0000123 YEAH YOU MENTIONED THE ASILOMAR STATEMENT OF OF PRINCIPLES   AH DO YOU JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000124 SURE AH SO  
POD1000000048_S0000125 TWO YEARS AGO   THERE WAS A CONFERENCE ON BENEFICIAL A I HELD IN PUERTO RICO   AND THAT LED TO AN OPEN AN OPEN LETTER ON A I  
POD1000000048_S0000126 AH AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOME INVESTMENT BY ELON MUSK IN THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE   AH WHICH SUPPORTED A LOT OF GRANTS IN THIS SPACE  
POD1000000048_S0000127 AH AND I THINK THAT THAT LED TO A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AND THERE WERE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE   BY INCLUDING A LOT OF A I SCIENTISTS   WHO SIGNED ONTO THAT AH LETTER  
POD1000000048_S0000128 AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES   AH WHICH WERE DEVELOPED AT A CONFERENCE TWO YEARS LATER   AH THIS YEAR AH AT ASILOMAR IN CALIFORNIA  
POD1000000048_S0000129 DEVELOPED A MORE AH SPECIFIC SET OF PROPOSALS FOR WHAT SORTS OF AH THINGS A I SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT   SO NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE RESEARCH   BUT ALSO AH THINGS LIKE CAPABILITY CAUTION  
POD1000000048_S0000130 SO BEING ATTENTIVE TO AH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF A I CAPABILITIES WILL AH WILL ULTIMATELY BE  
POD1000000048_S0000131 AND THE THINGS I MENTIONED ABOUT AVOIDING ARMS RACES AND AH BEING CONCERNED ABOUT AH A I WEAPONIZATION MORE BROADLY   SO AH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF DEVELOPING AH YOU KNOW SORT OF A CONSENSUS VIEW ON WHAT  
POD1000000048_S0000132 AH WHAT WE WANT TO SEE AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE   WE WANT TO SEE A I BENEFITING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE   AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT YOU KNOW AH LEADING TO THE ACCRUING OF BENEFITS TO A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR TO AH LARGE SCALE WAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000133 UM AND AH I THINK IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE NOT JUST THAT   BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SETS OF PRINCIPLES AH THROUGH THE IEEE AND THEIR AH EFFORT ON ETHICALLY ALIGNED AH A I DESIGN  
POD1000000048_S0000134 SO SO I READ THIS THIS PRINCIPLES AND THEY SEEM QUITE STRONG ON PAPER   AH DO YOU DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEM  
POD1000000048_S0000135 AH I THINK I THINK THERE'S SOMEWHAT OF A GAP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AH OF OF THE PRINCIPLES AND CONCRETE AH STEPS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE  
POD1000000048_S0000136 SO FOR EXAMPLE   IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHAT ANY INDIVIDUAL AH CAN DO TO STOP AN ARMS RACE   FOR EXAMPLE   BUT AH I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO KNOW WHERE WHERE YOU'RE HEADED  
POD1000000048_S0000137 AND THEN AH FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT IS IS THE NEXT STEP  
POD1000000048_S0000138 YEAH   SO AH IN IN YOUR GUIDE   YOU SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE COULD POTENTIALLY WORK ON A I STRATEGY AND POLICY QUESTIONS AT PLACES LIKE GOOGLE DEEPMIND OR OPENAI   WHERE WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ACTUALLY BEING AH DEVELOPED  
POD1000000048_S0000139 UM WHAT WHAT CONCRETELY COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE DOING AT PLACES LIKE THAT IF THEY TOOK A JOB THERE  
POD1000000048_S0000140 YEAH SO   SO SOME EXTENT   PEOPLE AT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE DOING SOMETHING FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE DOING AH IN ACADEMIA  
POD1000000048_S0000141 WHICH IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND TRYING TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS   AH I THINK THE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS IS TO AH HAVE MORE DIRECT EXPOSURE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND   SO TO SPEAK  
POD1000000048_S0000142 AH IN A I DEVELOPMENT   AND I THINK THAT CAN BE USEFUL AH FOR DEVELOPING A SET OF WHAT SORTS OF PROBLEMS ARE ACTUALLY CROPPING UP AH AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONES IN THE FUTURE  
POD1000000048_S0000143 THOUGH I THINK IT'S ALSO NOTABLE THAT AH PEOPLE AT THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THE EFFORTS THAT I'VE MENTIONED   SUCH AS AH RAISING ATTENTION TO A I SAFETY  
POD1000000048_S0000144 WHICH WAS AN INITIATIVE AH THAT THAT INVOLVED PEOPLE AT GOOGLE BRAIN AND OPENAI AND THE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN THE A I SAFETY PAPER  
POD1000000048_S0000145 AH AND PEOPLE AT DEEPMIND HAVE BEEN VERY AH INFLUENTIAL IN IN CALLING FOR MORE A I SAFETY WORK AND THEY'VE BEEN PUBLISHING AH FAIRLY EARLY ON THIS MATTER RELATIVE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000146 SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AH REASON TO THINK THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE PLAYING A POSITIVE ROLE AND I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO BE INVOLVED IN AH SORT OF THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON THESE TOPICS  
POD1000000048_S0000147 AS WELL AS DOING AH DIRECT RESEARCH  
POD1000000048_S0000149 AND HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A JOB AT A PLACE LIKE THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000151 I WOULD IMAGINE THEY NOT ONLY HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WORKING ON A I STRATEGY OR POLICY   ARE THESE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE ROLES  
POD1000000048_S0000152 I WOULD SAY THEY'RE PRETTY COMPETITIVE   AH AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW A GENERAL PHENOMENON IN ANYTHING RELATED TO A I THESE DAYS   WHETHER ON THE AH POLICY SIDE OR THE TECHNICAL SIDE  
POD1000000048_S0000153 UM BUT I I THINK THAT THIS IS A GROWTH AREA FOR SURE   SO AH IF IF ONE DEVELOPS EXPERTISE IN THIS TOPIC AH AND HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE  
POD1000000048_S0000154 THEN I THINK THERE WILL ULTIMATELY BE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE AH TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS  
POD1000000048_S0000155 IT'S AGAIN   I I WANNA YOU KNOW DRAW AN ANALOGY TO A I SAFETY WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WILL THERE BE JOBS IN A I SAFETY AH YOU KNOW THREE YEARS YEARS AGO   AND I THINK THAT DETERRED SOME GRAD STUDENTS FROM WORKING IN THIS SPACE AND  
POD1000000048_S0000156 NOW AH THE SITUATION SEEMS TO LOOK A BIT BETTER IN THAT THERE'S A FAIR NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR POSTDOCS AND AH PEOPLE BEING HIRED AT TOP AH TOP LABS TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES  
POD1000000048_S0000157 SO I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE SOMETHING PRETTY SIMILAR   AH NOT NECESSARILY BECOMING NOT COMPETITIVE   BUT AH THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE BIT OF AH SLACKENING OVER TIME AS AS THERE'S A NEED FOR DEVELOPING LARGER TEAMS TO WORK ON THESE TOPICS  
POD1000000048_S0000159 AND ANOTHER PATH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IS GOING INTO AH POLITICS OR POLICY ROLES   FOR EXAMPLE AS A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER OR PERHAPS AT A THINK TANK LIKE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE OR THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION   OR POTENTIALLY JUST GOING INTO PARTY POLITICS IN GENERAL  
POD1000000048_S0000160 AH WHAT USEFUL THINGS DO YOU ENVISAGE PEOPLE COULD DO THERE  
POD1000000048_S0000162 YEAH SO I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT WORKING AT AN A I LAB WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S AH PRACTICAL ON THE TECHNICAL FRONT  
POD1000000048_S0000163 AH WORKING FOR CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT OR AH YOU KNOW POLITICAL PARTY WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S PRACTICAL ON THE POLITICAL FRONT  
POD1000000048_S0000164 SO AH IN ADDITION TO THAT   DEVELOPING A BETTER INTUITION FOR THE THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE  
POD1000000048_S0000165 I THINK IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY A GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY INFLUENCE WHAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY DONE BY THOSE BODIES  
POD1000000048_S0000166 SO FOR EXAMPLE   AH IN AH THE U S CONGRESS RIGHT NOW   THERE WAS JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN A I CAUCUS AH TO ORGANIZE THE DISCUSSION OF AH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON ISSUES RELATED TO A I  
POD1000000048_S0000167 WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ISSUES AH RELATED TO THE FUTURE OF WORK   BUT I THINK OVER TIME   WE'LL SEE MORE AH DISCUSSION OF OF THE LONGER TERM SORTS OF ISSUES  
POD1000000048_S0000168 AH THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN IN THOSE FORA AND THEY WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT THING IS AH IS ULTIMATELY DONE WORKING IN THOSE PLACES  
POD1000000048_S0000169 AND ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACT ON THE BEST AH THE BEST CURRENT UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS AND BY PRACTITIONERS  
POD1000000048_S0000170 YEAH SO I THINK A BIG RISK OF GOING INTO AH POLITICS OR POLICY IN GENERAL WOULD BE THAT YOUR CAREER PROGRESSES   BUT YOU'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY IN ONE OF THE PLACES THAT ENDS UP AH HAVING A SAY IN HOW THESE THINGS GO  
POD1000000048_S0000171 UM YOU JUST END UP YOU KNOW BEING A YOU KNOW WORKING IN A IN IN A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE THAT THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THAT RELEVANT   AH ARE THERE ANY ROLES THAT THAT YOU CAN TAKE EARLY ON   OR WHAT CAN YOU DO TO POSITION YOURSELF WELL SO THAT YOU DON'T JUST GET SIDELINED IN THE END  
POD1000000048_S0000173 I THINK IF YOU INTEND TO WORK IN POLITICS   THEN YOU HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT OPPORTUNISTIC ABOUT AH JOBS AND THE EBB AND FLOW OF POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES   SO AH FOR EXAMPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000174 UM IF YOU KNOW ONE ONE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS DECLINING IN ITS RELEVANCE AH IN IN TERMS OF A I   THEN ONE SHOULD CONSIDER ABOUT AH YOU KNOW JUMPING SHIP TOWARDS SOMEWHERE THAT'S MORE RELEVANT  
POD1000000048_S0000175 AH SO I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW AH TAKING ONE PARTICULAR JOB WILL LOCK YOU IN FOREVER   AH BUT BUILDING UP SOME AH POLITICAL CAPITAL AND AH SOME AH HUMAN CAPITAL IN THAT AREA COULD BE USEFUL  
POD1000000048_S0000176 AH EVEN IF YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION   BUT I WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA OF UM YOU KNOW NOT BEING RELEVANT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AT THE UNDECIDED OF THE PEOPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000177 AH YOU'RE NOT AT THE AT THE ORGANIZATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING THE LATEST A I   AS I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE   I THINK THAT'S A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AH AND YOU KNOW ALONG WITH ACADEMIA   IT'S IT'S A GREAT GREAT PLACE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES  
POD1000000048_S0000178 BUT GOVERNMENTS STILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AH FRAMING THESE ISSUES AND IN CONVENING DISCUSSIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000179 FOR EXAMPLE OF AH EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT PUT OUT BY THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY LAST YEAR  
POD1000000048_S0000180 AH WHICH AH YOU KNOW WAS WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR WORKSHOPS THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER AH EXPERTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS   IN LAW AND ECONOMICS AH AND A I TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY  
POD1000000048_S0000181 AND SO I THINK AH YOU STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION AND MOVE THE BALL FORWARD   EVEN IF AH YOU'RE NOT AH WORKING IN THE LATEST LABS  
POD1000000048_S0000182 YEAH SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE BEST PLACES TO APPLY TO IN THAT AREA  
POD1000000048_S0000183 SO IT'S IT'S A BIT TRICKY TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL   IT DEPENDS ON AH FACTORS LIKE WHAT YOUR CITIZENSHIP IS AND AH WHAT PARTICULAR POLICY ISSUES YOU'RE INTERESTED IN  
POD1000000048_S0000184 BUT SOME AH FAIRLY ROBUST AH RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE TO AH LOOK FOR AH FOR FOR FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS  
POD1000000048_S0000185 ONE AREA TO LOOK AT WOULD BE TRIPLE A S FELLOWSHIPS   SO AH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE HAS A AH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM  
POD1000000048_S0000186 WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT PEOPLE IN AH ROTATIONS IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CONGRESS AND AH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH   WHERE THEY CAN AH IMPLEMENT SOME OF AH SOME THEY CAN YOU KNOW DRAW ON THEIR TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000187 SOME SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND IN A I WOULD PROBABLY END UP IN AN A I RELEVANT ORGANIZATION   SO I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT BEING A GOOD GOOD WAY TO DEVELOP CAREER CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS  
POD1000000048_S0000188 AH BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW GOING TO RESULT IN BEING IN THE EXACT RIGHT LOCATION FOR AH FOR YOU KNOW SOLVING A I POLICY PROBLEMS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS  
POD1000000048_S0000189 I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WHERE WHERE THAT WOULD BE AH OR EVEN IF THERE IS SUCH A PLACE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE STILL  
POD1000000048_S0000190 DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE   IN A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE   SO AH THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A RECOMMENDATION AH THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A NOMINATION FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE WHITE HOUSE  
POD1000000048_S0000191 SO AH OTHERWISE   I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS A GOOD PLACE TO TO GO   UM SO AH LIKEWISE   WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ON THE A I FRONT  
POD1000000048_S0000192 AH AND THERE'S A LOT OF UM THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION   BUT NOT MUCH AH INSTITUTION BUILDING AH IN IN GOVERNMENTS AT THE MOMENT   SO AH IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL  
POD1000000048_S0000193 BUT I THINK GETTING EXPERIENCE IS A PRETTY ROBUST THING TO DO  
POD1000000048_S0000194 RIGHT RIGHT UM SO SITUATION THAT I I ENCOUNTER REASONABLY OFTEN IS I MEET SOMEONE WHO'S REALLY SMART   WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC   WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION  
POD1000000048_S0000195 BUT AT THE MOMENT   UM THERE AREN'T THAT MANY GROUPS THAT ARE HIRING FOR THESE ROLES   AH YOU'RE AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE   AND I GUESS THERE'S ALSO THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE   UM BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES THAT SOMEONE AH CAN POTENTIALLY APPLY  
POD1000000048_S0000196 UM SOMETHING WHAT ADVICE SHOULD I GIVE SOMEONE IN THAT SITUATION   SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY CONTINUE STUDYING   PERHAPS   OR BUILDING EXPERTISE SO THAT THEY'RE IN A BETTER POSITION TO TO APPLY IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS GROWS   OR UM YEAH  
POD1000000048_S0000197 UM YEAH I MEAN AGAIN IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL   IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT  
POD1000000048_S0000198 BACKGROUND THE PERSON HAS AND WHAT WHAT SORTS OF JOBS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN   BUT I THINK AH IF ONE CASTS A FAIRLY LARGE NET IN TERMS OF WHAT A I ISSUES ONE WANTS TO WORK ON   THERE THERE'S A FAIRLY AH FAIRLY LARGE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000199 IT'S NOT JUST AH IT'S NOT JUST F H I   THERE'S ALSO AH THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EXISTENTIAL RISK   AH THE LEVERHULME CENTER FOR THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE   THE TECH POLICY LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON  
POD1000000048_S0000200 AH AND YOU KNOW VARIOUS FACULTY PROGRAMS   AROUND THE AH AH VARIOUS ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY   IN THE U S   AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE ARE LOOKING TO HIRE PEOPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000201 FOR EXAMPLE   AS POSTDOCS OR A FACULTY MEMBER IN IN AREAS RELATED TO A I AND POLICY IF IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WITH AN ACADEMIC BACKGROUND  
POD1000000048_S0000202 AND THERE ARE PROBABLY A FAIR NUMBER OF AH POLICY POSITIONS AT AH TECH COMPANIES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SPECIFIC TO A I   BUT THAT WOULD LEAD TO GETTING VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AH IN THE BROAD AREA OF TECH POLICY  
POD1000000048_S0000203 SO UM AGAIN TO GENERALIZE A BIT   I WOULD RECOMMEND CASTING A FAIRLY LARGE NET AND WORKING IN ADJACENT AREAS IF YOU CAN'T IMMEDIATELY WORK IN THE EXACT RIGHT PLACE  
POD1000000048_S0000204 AH BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOME NOT THE SORT OF AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A I POLICY FOR DECADES AND IT'S HARD TO BREAK IN FOR THAT REASON   IT'S MORE JUST AH THAT IT'S STILL A FIELD THAT'S GROWING  
POD1000000048_S0000205 AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT GROWTH WILL STOP   I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE   BUT IF IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY NOW  
POD1000000048_S0000206 THEN AH THEN YOU KNOW TALK TO PEOPLE AH IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE ON THE HORIZON AND TRY AND WORK IN ADJACENT FIELDS   THAT MIGHT BE ONE THING TO CONSIDER  
POD1000000048_S0000207 YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR SOMEONE STARTING OUT   TRYING TO START A CAREER IN THIS AREA  
POD1000000048_S0000208 AH DEPENDING ON ONE'S BACKGROUND   I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGE WOULD BE AH AH BONING UP ON AREAS OF WEAKNESS  
POD1000000048_S0000209 SO FOR EXAMPLE   IF YOU HAVE A POLICY BACKGROUND   YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON AH LEARNING MORE ABOUT A I   AH AND IF YOU HAVE A TECHNICAL BACKGROUND   YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON LEARNING ABOUT POLICY  
POD1000000048_S0000210 UM I I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AH CHALENGES IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT THERE NOT BEING A SUPER AH CLEARLY ACCESSIBLE LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC  
POD1000000048_S0000211 AND I I THINK THERE'S SOME EFFORT BEING AH GOING INTO ADDRESSING THAT WITH THE CAREER GUIDE AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY THAT I MENTIONED  
POD1000000048_S0000212 UM BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT THERE'S AH YOU KNOW ANY SPECIFIC SET OF PITFALLS THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND  
POD1000000048_S0000213 PEOPLE AVOID BESIDES YOU KNOW AH NOT UM YOU KNOW NEGLECTING THE THE AREAS IN WHICH AH THEY'RE WEAK   DON'T DON'T TRY AND REST ON YOUR LAURELS IN   SAY   TECHNICAL AREAS OR POLICY AREAS   BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AH AREA  
POD1000000048_S0000214 AND YOU WOULD NEED TO AH THINK ABOUT UM WHAT SORTS OF DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN   AND NOT JUST AH WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND   THOUGH OF COURSE YOU WANT TO DRAW ON YOUR STRENGTHS  
POD1000000048_S0000215 UM   I GUESS IT'S A IT'S A FIELD THAT IS IN IT'S FAIRLY EARLY STAGES AND IS IS GROWING QUICKLY  
POD1000000048_S0000216 AH IT IT'D BE A GOOD FIT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS REALLY ABLE TO SET THEIR OWN DIRECTION AND MEET PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY ATTRACT FUNDING TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO   SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WANT TO GO INTO  
POD1000000048_S0000217 YEAH   ABSOLUTELY AND I YEAH IT'S IT'S AN AREA THAT'S EVOLVING AND I THINK A LOT AH A LOT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000218 THAT EXIST TODAY AH AND I HAVE MENTIONED AS AS YOU KNOW GOOD PLACES TO WORK AND SO FORTH DIDN'T EXIST FIVE YEARS AGO SO YEAH  
POD1000000048_S0000220 YEAH   SOME OF THEM DIDN'T EXIST ONE YEAR AGO   SO AH IT'S IT'S AN AREA IN FLUX   AND I THINK YOU AS WITH POLITICS  
POD1000000048_S0000221 YOU SHOULD BE OPPORTUNISTIC THINK ABOUT THINKING YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT UM WHAT WHAT'S SORT OF UM YEAH WHAT WHAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE FOR YOU TO BE IN  
POD1000000048_S0000222 UM BUT YEAH   I THINK IT'S IT'S A VERY EXCITING AREA TO WORK IN AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT AH YOU KNOW IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEIR THEIR BACKGROUND  
POD1000000048_S0000223 UN   SO IF YOU HAD SOMEONE THAT COULD GO INTO ANY ORGANIZATION OR ROLE AND THAT'D BE A GOOD FIT   WHAT WHAT KIND OF AH PERSON WOULD YOU THINK IS MOST VALUABLE OUT OF EVERYTHING  
POD1000000048_S0000225 MOST VALUABLE PERSON   I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000226 YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000227 YEAH  
POD1000000048_S0000228 IS THERE ANY   IS THERE ANY AH SAY VACANCY OUT THERE THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOU JUST WISH THAT SOMEONE SOMEONE COULD FILL IT  
POD1000000048_S0000229 UM  
POD1000000048_S0000231 ANY ONE AH ONE ONE VACANCY THAT THAT COMES TO MIND IS AH FOR THE POLICY RESEARCHER POSITION AT DEEPMIND   SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY HIRING FOR FOR SOMEONE TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT A I POLICY  
POD1000000048_S0000232 SO I THINK THE THE THE CASE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO WORK AND A GOOD ROLE TO HAVE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN INFLUENCING THE CONVERSATION AROUND A I POLICY AND BEING EXPOSED TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS  
POD1000000048_S0000233 SO AH YEAH   IF YOU'RE IF YOU'D BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT AND YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT   YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY APPLY  
POD1000000048_S0000234 UM SO SO SOMETIMES AH I I FIND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK ON A I POLICY BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS QUITE CUT OUT FOR FOR TECHNICAL CORE RESEARCH   PERHAPS BECAUSE THEIR MATH SKILLS AREN'T QUITE GOOD ENOUGH  
POD1000000048_S0000235 AH IS THAT A SENSIBLE WAY TO GO   OR IS IN SOME WAYS THE A I STRATEGY WORK AH HARDER JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS CLEAR   IT'S LESS PRECISE THAN THAN TECHNICAL WORK  
POD1000000048_S0000236 UM I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S HARDER OR EASIER   IT'S JUST DIFFERENT   AH BUT EVEN EVEN ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE   THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF AH FUZZINESS  
POD1000000048_S0000237 SO AH YOU KNOW A I SAFETY WASN'T VERY CRISPLY DEFINED A FEW YEARS AGO   AND IT'S STARTING TO MOVE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF TECHNICAL RIGOR  
POD1000000048_S0000238 AND I THINK THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO A I POLICY TO SOME EXTENT   BUT THERE WILL ALSO ALWAYS BE SOME ELEMENT OF AH RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND AND YOU KNOW QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000239 THAT AH THAT CERTAINLY IS IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS AS SOLVING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS   SO AH YES   I DO THINK THAT HAVING AH A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND   WOULD AH IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT AREAS TO WORK WITH BASE BASED ON YOUR BACKGROUND  
POD1000000048_S0000240 BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT AH YOU KNOW WORKING ON THE SAFETY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY TECHNICAL AND THE POLICY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY NON TECHNICAL   AH BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S SOME CORRELATION THERE  
POD1000000048_S0000241 AND WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF TECHNICAL UM UNDERSTANDING DO YOU HAVE TO GET TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION  
POD1000000048_S0000242 UM I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU NEED ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION   SO AH FOR EXAMPLE   THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF ROLES THAT CAN BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST YOU KNOW GOOD AT DISTILLING THE LITERATURE ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC  
POD1000000048_S0000243 SO FOR EXAMPLE   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AH UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE THAT A I COULD AH PLAY IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES  
POD1000000048_S0000244 THEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ANY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO READ UP ON THE LITERATURE AROUND SURVEILLANCE AND COERCION AND AH AND THINGS LIKE THAT  
POD1000000048_S0000245 SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR AH JUST GOOD SYNTHESIZERS AND AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CURIOUS AND INTERESTED TO DIP IN AREAS THEY'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH  
POD1000000048_S0000246 UM BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO A FAIRLY HIGH CEILING FOR YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE USEFUL  
POD1000000048_S0000247 I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH VERY STRONG TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS THINKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE NITTY THE NITTY GRITTY GAME THEORY ISSUES RELATED TO ARMS RACES AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000248 SO I THINK YEAH IT'S A PRETTY IT'S A PRETTY BROAD RANGE OF POSSIBLE AH SKILL SETS THAT WOULD BE USEFUL  
POD1000000048_S0000249 RIGHT SO YOU'RE THINKING IF YOU CAN JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT   YOU CAN SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT AN A I MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF DOING IN THE FUTURE   AND THEN IF YOU KNOW ECONOMICS OR IF YOU KNOW SOCIAL SCIENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000250 THEN YOU CAN THINK   WHAT IMPLICATIONS WOULD THAT HAVE FOR POLITICS AND THAT KIND OF THING   EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SPECIFICALLY HOW THE HOW THE A I WOULD WORK  
POD1000000048_S0000251 YEAH   IDEALLY   YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH OF THOSE THINGS   BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING   IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING  
POD1000000048_S0000252 SO AH YOU IT'S NOT AH FEASIBLE TO TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY EVERY SINGLE DISCIPLINE OF OF WHICH I'LL LIST SEVERAL IN THIS AH POLICY AH CAREER GUIDE THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED  
POD1000000048_S0000253 AH CLEARLY   YOU CANNOT BE AN EXPERT AH YOU KNOW A DEEP EXPERT IN IN TECHNICAL A I   ECONOMICS   SOCIOLOGY   POLITICAL SCIENCE   ETC  
POD1000000048_S0000254 AH BUT KNOWING A LITTLE BIT AND AND BEING ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE WITH COMPLEMENTARY SKILL SETS IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE  
POD1000000048_S0000255 SO AH I THINK A LOT OF THE THE MOST EXCITING WORK IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL INVOLVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND ON THE POLICY SIDE  
POD1000000048_S0000256 RIGHT SO SO HOW CAN SOMEONE TELL WHICH WHICH KIND OF PATHS THEY'RE MOST SUITED FOR  
POD1000000048_S0000258 UM I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY CLEAR ALGORITHM FOR THIS   BUT TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND AND IN READING AH SOME OF THE LITERATURE AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE AH WHERE YOU THINK THE GAPS ARE  
POD1000000048_S0000259 WHAT AH WHAT AREAS YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SHED LIGHT ON GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING AH YOU SHOULD DO AH  
POD1000000048_S0000260 YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT SORTS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW CAST A FAIRLY BROAD NET YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO STRIKE YOUR INTEREST UNTIL YOU STUMBLE UPON THAT OPPORTUNITY  
POD1000000048_S0000261 AND NETWORKING IS ALSO SUPER HELPFUL   SO I THINK NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINDING OUT ABOUT JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND FIGURING OUT WHERE THERE'S A NICE FIT   BUT ALSO FINDING OUT ABOUT AH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES AND AH WHERE YOU MIGHT FIT IN IS AH ALSO USEFUL  
POD1000000048_S0000262 SO UM YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S AH A SINGLE ALGORITHM   BUT NETWORKING AND READING MORE OF THE LITERATURE AND LOOKING AT JOB JOB POSTINGS ARE ALL GOOD THINGS TO DO  
POD1000000048_S0000263 YEAH WHAT KINDS OF AH PLACES CAN PEOPLE NETWORK   ARE THERE ANY EVENTS THAT ARE OPEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T YET HAVE ROLES  
POD1000000048_S0000264 YEAH SO AH ALL OF THE A I CONFERENCES ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF AH YOU KNOW MAKE YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THE TRIP AND THE THE TICKET  
POD1000000048_S0000265 SO AH SO SOME EXAMPLES OF OF BIG A I A I CONFERENCES ARE NIPS   I C M L AH  
POD1000000048_S0000267 UM TRIPLE A I   AND SO FORTH  
POD1000000048_S0000268 UM AH YEAH NIPS YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST AH UM YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING CONFERENCE RIGHT NOW WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DEEP LEARNING   I C M L IS ALSO A VERY LARGE ONE   ACTUALLY   I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS BIGGER  
POD1000000048_S0000269 AH I HAVEN'T BEEN TO I C M L   BUT I'VE BEEN TO NIPS A FEW TIMES   AH I CLEAR I C L R IS AH ALSO A DEEP LEARNING SPECIFIC AH CONFERENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000270 SO I THINK GOING TO CONFERENCES LIKE THAT AND SPECIFICALLY GOING TO WORKSHOPS AND SYMPOSIA THAT ARE RELEVANT TO POLICY QUESTIONS   WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS AT THESE CONFERENCES  
POD1000000048_S0000271 AH SO FOR EXAMPLE   AT NIPS LAST YEAR   THERE WAS UM THERE WAS A SYMPOSIUM ON THE A I AND THE LAW   SO AH THERE  
POD1000000048_S0000272 THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT TO NETWORK AND FIND AH FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE THINKING AND TO MEET PEOPLE UM WHO HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS  
POD1000000048_S0000273 UM AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ON THE A I SIDE   IT'S ALSO AH IT'S ALSO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT MORE AH POLICY ORIENTED CONFERENCES   SO THERE'S SOME CONFERENCES LIKE THE GOVERNANCE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000274 AH THE WE ROBOT CONFERENCE SERIES   AND PROBABLY A FEW OTHERS THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST AH TO PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW EITHER ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND WANT TO MOVE IN A MORE THINKING ABOUT POLICY SIDE  
POD1000000048_S0000275 OR JUST THEY'RE IN THE POLICY SIDE BUT THEY WANNA YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY SEEK OUT PEOPLE INTERESTED IN A I   AH THOSE THOSE WOULD BE GOOD PLACES TO LOOK  
POD1000000048_S0000276 UM AND ARE ANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED OPEN ENOUGH THAT AH SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE AREA AH CAN CAN DROP BY AND AND GET TO KNOW PEOPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000277 YEAH SO UM I THINK AH PARTICULARLY ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE   THOUGH TO SOME EXTENT ALSO AT CORPORATIONS   AH THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF OPENNESS  
POD1000000048_S0000278 AND AH YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE   AT F H I   WE HOST A LOT OF VISITORS AH WHO JUST WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR WORK   AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS  
POD1000000048_S0000280 YEAH UM SO IT SOUNDED LIKE IN YOUR GUIDE   YOU THOUGHT THE BEST UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR WAS WAS SOMETHING LIKE COMBINING A TECHNICAL SUBJECT  
POD1000000048_S0000281 LIKE MATH OR COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH A MORE SOCIAL SCIENCE TOPIC LIKE POLITICS OR ECONOMICS  
POD1000000048_S0000282 UM ASSUMING THAT POST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN THEIR MAJOR   WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL   SHOULD SHOULD THEY DO A P H D OR JUST GO AND WORK DIRECTLY AT AT GOOGLE IF THEY CAN  
POD1000000048_S0000284 I  
POD1000000048_S0000286 I MEAN I'VE I'VE PROBABLY SAID THIS A MILLION TIMES   BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR ANSWER FOR EVERYONE AH BUT AH  
POD1000000048_S0000288 BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE AN ADVANCED DEGREE   OF COURSE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITY COSTS   BUT THERE THERE'S CERTAINLY MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO AH YOU KNOW HAS HAS A P H D  
POD1000000048_S0000289 SO FOR EXAMPLE   UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A HARD REQUIREMENT   AH BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE APPLYING TO A FAIR NUMBER OF INDUSTRY JOBS AH IF THEY HAD AN ADVANCED DEGREE  
POD1000000048_S0000290 UM AS WELL AS IN ACADEMIA   SO IT IT'S HARD TO AVOID THE FACT THAT AH YOU KNOW FOR ACADEMIC JOBS   AS MUCH AS AH UM YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW HIRE PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON THEIR DEMONSTRATED SKILLS  
POD1000000048_S0000291 OFTEN ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE ARE UNIVERSITY POLICIES SURROUNDING YOU KNOW WHAT SORTS OF DEGREES YOU NEED FOR FOR DIFFERENT ROLES AND AH PAY GRADES AND SO  
POD1000000048_S0000292 AH THERE'S DEFINITELY VALUE TO HAVING A GRADUATE DEGREE   AH DESPITE THE YOU KNOW NON TRIVIAL OPPORTUNITY COST IF FI YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY  
POD1000000048_S0000293 BUT AH YOU KNOW AS WITH ALL THESE THINGS   IT IT DEPENDS ON SOMEONE'S BACKGROUND AND IF YOU HAVE A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT  
POD1000000048_S0000294 AH AND YOU COULD YOU KNOW PERHAPS GET SOME OF THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BY YOU KNOW ALSO TAKING CLASSES ONLINE OR ENROLLING AT A LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND BEING A PART TIME P H D STUDENT OR MASTER'S STUDENT I THINK  
POD1000000048_S0000295 YEAH YOU SHOULD YEAH AH THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO   BUT AH IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON  
POD1000000048_S0000296 YEAH AND AND I GUESS THE MOST OBVIOUS OPTIONS AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL ARE THINGS LIKE MACHINE LEARNING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE OR OR ECONOMICS SO I GUESS PUBLIC POLICY   IS THAT USEFUL  
POD1000000048_S0000297 YEAH SO AH UM YEAH JUST TO GIVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE   UM AT OXFORD WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN A I SAFETY AND A I POLICY   AS WELL AS BROADER ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUTURE  
POD1000000048_S0000298 UM AND YOU KNOW JUST AT THE ORGANIZATION THAT I'M AT   F H I   THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER CURRENTLY ENROLLED OR WHO SOON WILL BE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS AH IN MINE   WHICH IS HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  
POD1000000048_S0000299 AS WELL AS MACHINE LEARNING   AH CYBER SECURITY   AND ZOOLOGY   SO THERE THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE AREAS THAT ONE COULD STUDY AND YOU KNOW FIND AN ADVISOR THAT IS SUITABLE AND INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING YEAH INTERESTING WORK  
POD1000000048_S0000301 YEAH SO SO SOME PEOPLE WORRY THAT DOING WORK IN THIS THIS IN THIS AREA COULD COULD BE HARMFUL IF NOT DONE WELL   AH SO FOR EXAMPLE   IT COULD BE THAT   AS YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER   THAT REGULATION IN THIS AREA AH COULD COULD BE DONE POORLY AND WOULD ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL OVERALL  
POD1000000048_S0000302 OR THAT BRINGING GREATER ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE COULD COULD REINFORCE THE ARMS RACE DYNAMIC   OR TENTATIVELY   HAVING PEOPLE AH GET INVOLVED WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE COULD COULD BRING THE AREA INTO DISREPUTE  
POD1000000048_S0000303 AH HOW SERIOUSLY DO YOU TAKE THOSE KINDS OF CONCERNS   SHOULD SHOULD PEOPLE BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ABOUT AH JUMPING INTO THE AREA IF IF THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE REALLY ON TOP OF THINGS  
POD1000000048_S0000304 UM I  
POD1000000048_S0000306 THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE CONCERN   AH AND YEAH THERE THERE IS  
POD1000000048_S0000307 IN FACT   SOME SOME RISK OF AH YOU KNOW DISCREDITING YOURSELF OR YOUR CAUSE BY AH BY BEING UM YOU KNOW TOO TOO ALARMIST OR WHATEVER THE PARTICULAR CHARGE MIGHT BE  
POD1000000048_S0000308 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND   THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE IN THE SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT   AND WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE NEAR TERM   THERE WILL BE TERMINATOR PICTURES AND AND PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW DISMISS A I SAFETY AND AH ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL  
POD1000000048_S0000309 SO I I THINK THEY'RE ALSO RISKS OF NOT ACTING   WHICH IS YOU KNOW NOT AH YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO AH HELP OUT WHEN THERE'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE  
POD1000000048_S0000310 SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IF IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS YOU   THEN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR BELIEFS AND WHAT YOUR BELIEFS ARE YOU KNOW  
POD1000000048_S0000311 WHETHER THERE'S YOU KNOW AND LOOK AT SURVEYS OF EXPERTS AND YOU KNOW SEE SEE HOW AH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THE YOU KNOW REASONABLE DISTRIBUTION IS AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED THE TOPIC MORE  
POD1000000048_S0000312 SO AH I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW AN ALL OR NOTHING SORT OF THING WHERE YOU EITHER HAVE TO STAY IGNORANT OR BE A SUPER EXPERT  
POD1000000048_S0000313 I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE YOU SORT OF YOU KNOW DEVELOP YOUR CONFIDENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE AS YOU GO   AND TRYING AH REMAIN AS MODEST AS POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE EXPERTISE  
POD1000000048_S0000314 YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ALWAYS TRACK THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR NICK BOSTROM ARE SAYING AND HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUES   SO THAT YOU SO YOU DON'T COME ACROSS AS ALARMIST AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE A MEASURED AND PRECISE TONE  
POD1000000048_S0000315 RIGHT RIGHT  
POD1000000048_S0000316 YEAH SO SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT A I AH COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS   AND THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THINGS COULD GO BADLY   UM GIVEN THAT   DO YOU SEE MUCH VALUE IN PEOPLE GOING INTO MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE ROLES TO WITH WITH THE HOPE OF LIMITING THIS AH IN THE IN THE FUTURE  
POD1000000048_S0000318 POSSIBLY   AH IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY   IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR ROLE   SO AH PROBABLY A ROLE YOU KNOW HIGHER UP IN THE CHAIN AND MORE ON THE POLICY AND STRATEGY SIDES OF THINGS  
POD1000000048_S0000319 AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE OPERATIONAL OR LOGISTICAL OR JUST EXECUTION SIDE OF THINGS AH WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO AFFECT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS  
POD1000000048_S0000320 BUT AH THERE MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFITS TO THAT AH BEYOND JUST AH YOU KNOW HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ISSUE WHILE IN THAT ROLE  
POD1000000048_S0000321 YOU COULD ALSO THEN DEVELOP VALUABLE CONNECTIONS AND AH KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE AH DOWN THE ROAD OR AH HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROBLEM AH AND YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SOLVE IT SO  
POD1000000048_S0000322 AH I I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T AH DISMISS IT   BUT I ALSO YOU KNOW WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND IT ACROSS THE BOARD AS AS THE BEST THING TO DO  
POD1000000048_S0000323 YEAH I I GUESS THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND MILITARY ARE JUST SUCH ENORMOUS BUREAUCRACIES   I SUPPOSE I'D I'D WORRY THAT SOMEONE YOU LIKE AH IT'S JUST UNLIKELY PERHAPS THAT YOU WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME   OR OR HAVE ENOUGH DISCRETION IN THOSE ROLES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE  
POD1000000048_S0000324 BUT AS YOU SAY   IT COULD COULD HELP YOU TO BUILD UP YOUR CAREER CAPITAL SO YOU CAN GET AH OTHER OTHER GOOD   USEFUL ROLES IN THE FUTURE   AND AND YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS   SO YOU COULD POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE IT AH FROM OUTSIDE AND TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000325 YEAH   EXACTLY   SO AH YOU KNOW AGAIN   IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON AND WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE   BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH CONSIDERING  
POD1000000048_S0000326 UM WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY   COULD IT BE USEFUL TO GO INTO DEPARTMENT OF STATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WORK ON ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS  
POD1000000048_S0000327 SO YOU KNOW EVEN JUST CURRENT ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS SO YOU YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK AND CAN THINK ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT WORK FOR A I IN FUTURE  
POD1000000048_S0000329 YEAH SO I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY USEFUL   AH LOOKING AT ARMS CONTROL AND FOREIGN POLICY   YOU KNOW BOTH FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A PRACTITIONER PERSPECTIVE   I THINK IT'S VERY VALUABLE  
POD1000000048_S0000330 AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT AH WERE NOT THAT'S NOT OUR STRONG SUIT IN THE A I SAFETY AND POLICY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW  
POD1000000048_S0000331 AH SO MORE MORE COULD BE DONE ON THAT FRONT   AH BUT I I THINK SOME OF THE SAME CAVEATS APPLY TO THE THE AS TO THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SIDE OF THINGS   THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT   FOR EXAMPLE   IS A VERY LARGE BUREAUCRACY  
POD1000000048_S0000332 YEAH AH AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UM JUST MORE GENERAL ATTEMPTS TO AH TO MAKE THE WORLD AH AH BETTER   SUCH THAT WHEN A I IS DEVELOPED   THINGS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO WELL  
POD1000000048_S0000333 FOR EXAMPLE   JUST IMPROVING THE YOU KNOW QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT AH IN GENERAL   TRYING TO GET GET THE RIGHT KINDS OF PEOPLE ELECTED   OR IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST THE FUTURE ACROSS THE BOARD  
POD1000000048_S0000335 IS IS I GUESS ONE WORRY WOULD BE THAT THAT'S JUST NOT SUFFICIENTLY LEVERAGED ON ON THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM   AND IF YOU THINK A I IS REALLY LIKELY TO BE THE KEY ISSUE   THEN YOU WANT TO WORK ON THAT SPECIFICALLY  
POD1000000048_S0000336 UM BUT MAYBE IF YOU COULD IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE FUTURE ACROSS THE BOARD   THEN THAT COULD BE A BETTER OPTION   AND ALSO   UM YOU JUST HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OPEN TO BROADER WAYS OF IMPROVING THE WORLD  
POD1000000048_S0000337 YEAH I I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR DECISION FOR EVERYONE   BUT IT IT BOTH AT THE YOU KNOW GROUP LEVEL AND AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL   IT OFTEN MAKES SENSE TO TAKE A SUM IT UP A PORTFOLIO APPROACH  
POD1000000048_S0000338 SO AH THERE ARE PEOPLE AT F H I WHO ALSO ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM   AND INVOLVED IN BUILDING THE E A COMMUNITY AH LIKE OWEN COTTON BARRATT AND TOBY ORD  
POD1000000048_S0000339 SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STRADDLE AH THAT BOUNDARY AND AND YOU KNOW LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT BOTH SIDES   AND THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE AH YOU KNOW WHO FOCUS ON ONE THING OR THE OTHERS  
POD1000000048_S0000340 SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR RIGHT ANSWER   BUT AH CERTAINLY THE THE SORTS OF TRADE OFFS YOU MENTION SOUND REASONABLE   ON THE ONE HAND   ONE WOULD WANT AH THE WORLD TO BE IN A BETTER PLACE  
POD1000000048_S0000341 FOR THERE TO BE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT AH MAKING AH MAKING GOOD DECISIONS AND BENEFITING AH FUTURE PEOPLE UM IN IN VARIOUS IMPORTANT DECISION MAKING ROLES  
POD1000000048_S0000342 AH BUT THERE IT IT'S QUITE UNCERTAIN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IMPACT YOU COULD HAVE ON A I   AND LIKEWISE   EVEN EVEN IF YOU WORK DIRECTLY ON A I   IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT AH THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEST THING YOU SHOULD DO  
POD1000000048_S0000343 BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A SLIGHTY YOU KNOW BIAS TOWARDS THINKING THAT WORK THAT DIRECT WORK IS IS AH YOU KNOW NEEDS MORE ATTENTION AT THE MOMENT   UM BUT AH I THINK YOU KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT  
POD1000000048_S0000344 BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE MORE PEOPLE TO HELP SOLVE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS I'M WORKING ON  
POD1000000048_S0000345 SO SO WE SHOULD POTENTIALLY CONTINUE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED   WE'LL JUST BECOME A I RESEARCHERS RIGHT AWAY  
POD1000000048_S0000346 RIGHT  
POD1000000048_S0000347 SO SO THAT'S AH THAT'S ALL OF MY QUESTIONS   WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD  
POD1000000048_S0000348 ANY INSPIRING MESSAGE  
POD1000000048_S0000349 UM YEAH   I MEAN I'LL JUST CIRCLE BACK ON WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER   WHICH IS THAT AH A I SAFETY WAS IN A VERY AH UM NEBULOUS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT A FEW YEARS AGO  
POD1000000048_S0000350 AND IT TOOK THE WORK OF AH NICK BOSTROM IN SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND STUART RUSSELL IN GIVING A LOT OF TALKS AND WRITING OP EDS TO CALL MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND GIVE IT MORE LEGITIMACY  
POD1000000048_S0000351 AH AND THEN SUBSEQUENT WORK WAS DONE TO REFINE THE ISSUE AND DEVELOP RESEARCH AGENDAS AH AH BY BY PEOPLE   INCLUDING THE AUTHORS OF HE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN A I SAFETY PAPER  
POD1000000048_S0000352 AH AND NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF POSTDOCS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON THIS   WE HAVE PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON WELL DEFINED PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE  
POD1000000048_S0000353 AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SIMILAR TRANSITION IN A I POLICY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS  
POD1000000048_S0000354 TO REMOVING FROM AH FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL DESIDERATA AND AND PROBLEM FRAMINGS TO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND AH YOU KNOW AH FORMAL MODELS AND AH YOU KNOW AH GOOD WHITE PAPERS  
POD1000000048_S0000355 AND SO FORTH AH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS   AND IT'S IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE'S EXPERTISE   SO I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO AH WHO YOU KNOW THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME RELEVANT EXPERTISE TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER  
POD1000000048_S0000356 UM YEAH I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT   SINCE I WROTE OUR PROBLEM PROFILE ON POSITIVELY SHAPING ARTIFICIAL DEVELOPMENT   WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS IS THE MOST NEGLECTED AREA AH WITHIN WITHIN THE A I SAFETY  
POD1000000048_S0000357 AH AND I'M I'M VERY KEEN TO GET AH MORE PEOPLE AH WORKING ON THESE ON THESE PROBLEMS AND GETTING MORE ORGANIZATIONS   AH HIRING FOR THEM   AH SO IF IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN  
POD1000000048_S0000358 I THINK YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE BE LOOKING INTO IT MORE   AND AND WE'LL PUT UP AH LINKS TO TO GUIDES WHERE YOU CAN AH FIND OUT MORE AND AND MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE  
POD1000000048_S0000360 YEAH   THANKS SO MUCH AND HAVE A GREAT DAY   AND LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING IN FUTURE
